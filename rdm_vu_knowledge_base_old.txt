### Topic: Contributing – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/contributing.html

#### Subtopic: Contributing portal
We offer a portal to reduce the barriers to contribute to the Research Support Handbook. You only need an internet connection and articulate what you want us to include. No accounts necessary 😊 Open the contribution portal byclicking hereor copy-pasting:https://ez-github-contributor.netlify.app/ You can report issues you find with the Research Support Handbook using the “Report a problem” tab. This is a way for you to share your feedback with us. You can propose new topics or guides to the Research Support Handbook using the “Propose new page” tab. This will be considered for inclusion. Please mention whether it should be a topic or a guide. The text editor allows you to use rich text formatting. The portal does not save your work. Use the portal when you are ready to submit your work, but do not use it to manage your submissions. If you want to be credited with contributing, please share your name. If you’d like to hear back about what was done with your feedback or proposal, please also provide a direct way to contact you. Once you have submitted the contribution, the editors will decide how to add your contribution to the handbook. Take a look at theEditor’s guideto learn more about what criteria they consider.

#### Subtopic: Contributing via GitHub
For the next steps you need a GitHub account to contribute. You cancreate one directly on GitHub.

#### Subtopic: Suggesting edits
The easiest and quickest way to contribute to the book is make suggested edits. On each page you will find a button reading “Edit this page” (usually on the right). When you click that, you will immediately be taken to GitHub to edit the text of that specific page. You may be prompted tocreate a fork (forking)in case these are your first edits. Once you made your edits, you are ready to commit (save) your changes andsubmit your pull request, requesting those changes to be included in the handbook.

#### Subtopic: Adding a topic
To add a new topic, you need to create a new file ending in.qmdin thetopicsfolder (e.g.,topics/example.qmd). You can do this by visiting thehandbook page on GitHuband clickingAdd file -> New file. When you click this button you may be asked toforkthe repository. This is not a problem so go ahead! The topic itself needs to bewritten in Markdown. Every topic must be a noun/noun phrase and contain the title as such: Section headings are second level headings (e.g.,## Section). You can add all needed information as you want, but please mind that topics are supposed to short and self-contained for readers of the Research Support Handbook. After that, you are ready tosubmit your pull request! The reviewers will help you place the topic in the right place of the book.

#### Subtopic: Adding a guide
To add a new guide, you need to create a new file ending in.qmdin theguidesfolder (e.g.,guides/example.qmd). You can do this by visiting thehandbook page on GitHuband clickingAdd file -> New file. When you click this button you may be asked toforkthe repository. This is not a problem so go ahead! Every guide title must reflect the question the guide answers. Add the title by adding the following information at the top of your document: Section headings are second level headings (e.g.,## Section). The guide itself needs to bewritten in Markdown. You can re-use topics literally in your guides. For each topic you want to include, you can either mention so on a line surrounded by whitespaces: This will tell the editorial team to include that topic there. Please be specific in naming the topic. You can also directly include the topic yourself directly using the following code: You need to count the heading level in your guide to identify your shift number. In this case, there are two##so we shift by two. You can verify the filename directly, but it should correspond to each word separated by a minus sign (for example,data-management-plan.qmd). After that, you are ready tosubmit your pull request!

#### Subtopic: Editing multiple files
There are situations in which you need to edit multiple files. If you carry out all edits in separatepull requests, this may be a long and repetitive task. Instead, you can change multiple files at once in a single pull request. In case you want to edit multiple files in one go, here’s a video to help you along the way! Video

#### Subtopic: Submit a pull request
Once you have made suggested changes, a pull request is the way for you to ask for your changes to be incorporated into the Research Support Handbook. The handbook editors will review what you wrote, ask some questions, and accept or decline your contributions. We recommend keeping your suggested changes small or limited in scope, and explaining why you are suggesting these changes. It is more likely your changes are included when you are fixing a typo or adding a paragraph, and less likely if you are revising the entire handbook. It is also more likely they are included if you explain why you are suggesting the changes, rather than dropping by and making edits without any context. If you are adding anewtopic or guide, it is definitely recommended toopen an issue firstto see whether there is a need for it (and maybe you’ll find collaborators!). During the review process you may be asked to update your changes, or revisions may be added by the people maintaining the handbook. It is helpful if you keep an eye on your GitHub account to ensure timely responses to help the process along. By contributing, you become part of the process :blush:. Once you have submitted the contribution, the editors will decide how to add your contribution to the handbook. Take a look at theEditor’s guideto learn more about what criteria they consider.

#### Subtopic: Writing text
The book is created using Markdown - you can get familiarized withthe basic syntax on the Markdown website. The getting started quick items are: If you want to add code, use references, create links, or footnotes - it is all possible. We will expand examples here based on your needs, so if you need help,let us know by reporting an issue! Often, you will want to link to other pages or sections in the Research Support Handbook. Instead of going to the website, and pasting the link from there (for example,https://ubvu.github.io/open-handbook/contributing.html), you can add what is called “relative links.” Relative links require three concepts: Working directory: The folder in which the file you are editing is located ./= indicates the current folder ../= indicates the folder one level up This Contributing guide is located in the “root” directory, and there is no upper folder. If we wanted to link to a topic, we would use../topics/example-topic.qmd. This would create a relative link to the example file. Relative links link to the.qmdfiles, never to the.htmlpages. These only exist when the pages are rendered! If we were editing a topic, and we wanted to link out to a guide, we would need to use../guides/example-guide.qmd. This because we would be in the topic folder for that file, and need to navigate one level up (../) and then down into the guides folder. For topic to topic references, we do the same (../topics/example-topic.qmd). This ensures that the links work also when a topic is embedded into a guide directly. Whenever we link to a specific guide or topic, you can also link to a specific section. This helps you point readers to what you want them to read, and helps them find the information they need. The easiest way to find these section links is to navigate to the relevant page, and click on the link icon next to the heading. This will cause your URL to change. You add the#adding-a-guide(as applicable in your case) to the end of your relative link, and you will have created a relative section link! :blush: If the section is on the same, you can drop the relative link altogether and keep only the part after the#(for example,#adding-a-guide).

#### Subtopic: Adding images
In markdown, you can easily add images and alt text at the same time. We require alt text on all images, and if you are contributing an image, you can best describe its value in the text. You add images by using: If you want the image to be hosted in the Research Support Handbook, use the following steps: Add the image you want to thepublic/folder Mark the exact filename Use../public/<filename>as the URL for the image (for example../public/image.png)

#### Subtopic: More information about GitHub
We useGitHubto create this website automatically, and to manage all the incoming updates. You do not need to know how it works entirely, but we want to help you understand some things so you are not confused. A repository on GitHub is like a folder on your computer. This can be many things, depending on what files it contains. When we mention a repository here, we mean that we want you to look at a specific folder. Therepository for this website for example can be found on GitHub directly. You will always be contributing to a repository, in order to contribute to the handbook. A repository is owned by one or multiple people on GitHub. If you are not one of them, you can create a copy of the repository (folder) to make your edits in. This act of creating a copy is called “forking.” When you create a copy, you do not have to worry about accidentally removing or destroying the handbook. Your changes are not reflected in the website until yousubmit a pull request.

#### Subtopic: Adding references
If you want to include references throughout the handbook, we recommend you do so in the following way.

#### Subtopic: Add the BibTex
You can find the relevant BibTeX information using a tool likethe DOI to BibTeX converter. Counterintuitively, it also works on ISBNs for example. After you found the BibTeX information, you add it to thereferences.bibfile (preferably all the way at the bottom). Example BibTeX information is:

#### Subtopic: Add the citation
To add the citation to a page, you use[@example-code]or@example-code. @example-codewill result in an in-text citation, like “Author (2042).” [@example-code]will result in a regular citation such as “(Author, 2042)”. For more details on citations,see also the Quarto help page on citations.

#### Subtopic: Rendering handbook locally
Sometimes you may want to preview the changes you are making to the handbook. That is possible in most cases, but requires you to install some software.You need to install Quartoand assuming a successful installation, you then need to run the following code in your terminal1: This will create a file called _site/index.html. You can now open the rendered website in your browser by running: Note that you should not copy the < and >, they are written here to indicate where the browser name should come. You can also make changes locally and push them to the github repo to open a new branch. The procedure for this in your terminal is as follows: Once you are done editing, you can also render the page to check that all is well. If you have already usedquarto render .once, you can simply re-render the page you were working on, usingquarto render <path/filename.qmd>, e.g.quarto render ./topics/yoda.qmd, which is a lot quicker. Note that you should not copy the < and >, they are used here to indicate where to add file and folder names, or a suitable commit message. Once you are happy with the result, you can push the new version back to the github repository online: Note that you should not copy the < and >, they are written here to indicate where file and folder names should be written. After doing this, your new branch is opened in the repository on GitHub and you can create a pull request. This procedure requires some background knowledge on working (with git) in the command line. The resources below give more explanation: Navigating Files and DirectoriesandCreate a text filefrom the Carpentries’ Unix Shell lesson. CollaboratingandPush local branches to a remotefrom the Carpentries’ Version Control with Git lesson. We do not guarantee this will work immediately, but should cover most instances. If you are looking to contribute and want to render things locally, try this first, and if you run into any issues,let us know in an issue report. We’re happy to try our best if you share your error messages 😊

#### Subtopic: Using VS Code to contribute
If you are planning to make multiple contributions to the Handbook, working in the GitHub web interface can get cumbersome. In that case we suggest you use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to create and edit pages. An IDE is a text editor that has lots of extra functionalities for developers, such as integration with Git.VS Codeis a widely used, free, IDE and it is very well suited to edit Markdown files and has integrated Git & GitHub support. This allows you to work on your edits on your laptop whenever you want, preview them using the Quarto client andPushyour changes to GitHub. No special knowledge of the Git Commandline is necessary.

#### Subtopic: Install VS Code
VS Code is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Install it fromhttps://code.visualstudio.com/Download. Note that VS Code is a Microsoft product, but the source code of VS Code is open source. The VS Code version you download from the above link is not, and it contains telemetry/tracking. A completely open source version without telemetry is available fromhttps://vscodium.com, the functionality is the same.

#### Subtopic: Install the Quarto extension for VS Code
Install theQuarto Extensionto make sure VS Code understands the Quarto format. Note that unfortunately the Preview functionality does not work very well with a project as large as the Handbook.

#### Subtopic: Make sure Git is installed
Open VS Code and click on the Git icon on the left. If you do not have Git installed you can do so from here, the download button will lead you tohttps://git-scm.com/downloads, you do not need the GUI client. - During the install you can set VS Code as default editor Keep defaults for the rest. Keep defaults for the rest. Open a command prompt to set your username and email address, without this you cannotpushyour changes to GitHub. Open a command prompt to set your username and email address, without this you cannotpushyour changes to GitHub.

#### Subtopic: Create a root folder
Create a folder where your handbook copy and other code projects will be stored. For example on WindowsC:\users\<username>\VS Code. Note that it is not advisable to store code projects in a folder which is synced with OneDrive (such as the “Documents’ folder), OneDrive will have problems syncing the many small files that git uses. The same applies to SURFdrive and Research Drive. You will push changes to your code projects to github so there is no need to make extra backups.

#### Subtopic: Create a Fork of the Handbook
Go to theHandbook repository on GitHub. - Click Fork button at the top right. - You end up with all the code in your personal account.

#### Subtopic: Clone your Fork
Go to the Git Tab (or click File > New window), there you will see the option to “Clone Repository”. - You see the option “Clone from GitHub”. If you have never signed in with Git before you will be asked to do so. Click Allow. If you have never signed in with Git before you will be asked to do so. Click Allow. The GitHub Sign In page will be opened in the Browser. Login as usual. The GitHub Sign In page will be opened in the Browser. Login as usual. Once you are signed in you can select from a list of repositories. - Select the Fork you created earlier. - Select yourcode root folder. A folder calledopen-handbookwill be created in that folder and you can open it in VS Code.

#### Subtopic: Editing
Now you have a full copy of the Handbook on your laptop. Of course you are not working on the Handbook directly, but on yourFork. You can make changes to the actual Handbook by making changes to yourForkand creating aPull Request. ThePull Requestwill be opened in the ubvu open-handbook repository. The editors can then approve your request, perhaps after suggesting some changes, and your changes will bemergedtordm.vu.nl. The handbook is a collaborative effort, multiple people will be making changes to multiple files at the same time. To prevent 2 or more contributors making changes to the same file you should keep the number of files you change in yourPull requestssmall, preferrably just one page at a time. The best way to do this is to start by creating abranchfor the changes you want to make. - Provide a name for the branch. Keep it short and descriptive, this is mainly for yourself so you can easily remember what you created the branch for. VS Code will automatically switch to the branch. You can always see the branch you are working on in the bottom left of the Window. You can click on the name there to switch the branch you are working on. Remember your changes are tied to the branch. If you would switch from thezenodo_topicbranch to themainbranch you will no longer see the changes you made to the Zenodo topic page. But if you have committed your changes they will be visible again once you switch back. VS Code is basically just a text editor. Open the file you want to work on by double clicking or right click to create a new one in the “Explorer”. TheQuarto Extensionincludes aVisual Editorwith which you can format Quarto pages without typing Markdown code. Work on your page and save your changes (Click File > Save or useCTRL+S). VS Code will show you the changes with respect to the branch. Now you cancommit Click on the Git icon on the left. - Set a short descriptivecommit message, click the plus sign next to the files you want in your commit, and click commit. By double-clicking on aModifiedfile you will see a visual representation of your changes. Now you have committed your changes to the local git repository on your laptop. You will also need topublish the branchto github, so it gets updated as well. You will be able to view the branch on github. VS Code will now allow you toSync(PushandPull) your commits to the branch on GitHub. Once you are happy with the changes you made you cansubmit a Pull requeston GitHub. The VS Code documentation has a niceintroduction to Git sectionwith more useful tips. TheQuarto tutorialhas more tips on using VS Code to edit Quarto pages. To use the visual editor right-click anywhere in the document you are working on, or useCTRL+SHIFT+F4 You can now format text using a simple menu bar, instead of typing Markdown code.

### Topic: Editor’s guide – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/editors-guide.html

#### Subtopic: What does an editor do?
Editors tie together all the strings in this VU Amsterdam community handbook. We keep a bird’s eye view to ensure that what you read makes sense. Editors also help ensure the style and quality of the different pages are similar. Editors also help keep the content relevant to the entirety of VU Amsterdam (faculty specific information is not within scope). Each editor commits themselves to providing timely reviews of topics, guides, or both.1This commitment is for a limited time and can be renewed. We also welcome more editors at any time, given that we do not expect all editors to review everything. Editors also are responsible for managing time-sensitive merging of Pull Requests on GitHub. Sometimes, we know things have to change on a specific date. To do this, we can schedule PR merges by adding the relevant date in the opening comment of the Pull Request (example; editors can edit comments): As we go on this journey together, we may assign more specific responsibilities as they emerge.

#### Subtopic: Quality standards
As editors, we maintain a bunch of quality standards, both automated and not automated. If you are reading this as a contributor, you will greatly help us out by taking these into account. Here are some quality standards we maintain throughout the handbook: Writing must be primarily in active voice, both for consistent and engaging text across all pages Acronyms must be written in full at least once on the page where they are used All changes to the handbook are made via pull requests. Each change needs approval from two editors.Pull requests may not be merged if the QA automations fail Pull requests may not be merged if the QA automations fail Links must behttps:// All images must have alt text Links must be descriptive (no “click here” links) No writing in name of the handbook (for example, “we recommend repository X”) Where possible, pages with a DOI must link through the DOI (for example,https://doi.org/10.4444/xxxxinstead of the direct linkhttps://nature.com/...) We try to automate most of these rules, but this is not always possible or accurate enough.

#### Subtopic: Topics
For topics we maintain an additional set of standards: Topics must be nouns or noun phrases Topics are self-contained and aim for brevity All topics must be title capitalized (see also the helpful toolCapitalizeMyTitle.com) Noincludestatements are allowed in topicsInclude statements must be prefaced with the relevant section heading, as the title of a topic is not reproduced. Include statements must be prefaced with the relevant section heading, as the title of a topic is not reproduced. No use of special Quarto code is allowed. Only use regular markdown in topics.

#### Subtopic: Guides
For guides we maintain other standards: Guides must be phrased as questions that the reader will get answers to (for example, “how do I preserve data?”)

#### Subtopic: How to keep an overview of everything?
With so many issues and pull requests, it is easy to get lost as an editor. We have a project management board that can be helpful identifying what is going on at this time: Topics Guides

#### Subtopic: Etiquette
As editors, we may have to make tough calls at times. It is important for us to make people feel welcome and appreciated, even if their contribution is not immediately included. That being said, we reciprocate the consideration given to us. We operate under a generosity policy, and if reciprocated, we stay generous.

#### Subtopic: GitHub etiquette
As editors, we also maintain a certain GitHub etiquette. It is necessary to make managing a project with so many moving pieces and contributors. Important is: New topics or guides must be linked to the issue proposing it Each pull request should have a clear purpose and stick to it (for example, no editing a guide when proposing a topic) Item 2 also means changes should be branch specific, as pull requests are based off branches. It makes it much harder to review things if there are many different kinds of changes, as we editors will need to keep track of all of this. Simplicity is our friend. Simplicity helps us from making mistakes.

#### Subtopic: Hackathon protocol
We sometimes run hackathons to create space to contribute. We run hackathons as follows: Preparation: Hackathons are two hours long Hackathons are run using Zoom Each hackathon has a theme (it helps focus people’s energy on something and can inspire participation) We use a collaborative note taking document that requires no logging in, which is the central place to navigate the hackathon Assign a host During: Open 10 breakout rooms in zoom, allowing participants to freely move around The host……Welcomes everyone with an icebreaker question…Shares the link to the note taking document when people join…Sets the stage for the hackathon when it starts…Announces a break at the halfway mark …Welcomes everyone with an icebreaker question …Shares the link to the note taking document when people join …Sets the stage for the hackathon when it starts …Announces a break at the halfway mark Keep track of all the issues and pull requests opened for the speed blog After: Finish up the speed blog for the hackathon within one week of the hackathon. It does not have to be perfect and is primarily to document that the hackathon happened and some of the things that were done.

#### Subtopic: Troubleshooting
There are some common mistakes that can happen. We keep track of some of the quirks we observed to help you troubleshoot independently: Is the filename.qmdexactly? Is the relative path from topic -> topic../topics/name.qmd?

#### Subtopic: Footnotes
Each editor chooses which of these they want to focus on. Editors get auto-invited to review the changes. Timely means within a week.↩︎ Each editor chooses which of these they want to focus on. Editors get auto-invited to review the changes. Timely means within a week.↩︎

#### Subtopic: How is the website built?
We use GitHub Actions to build the Quarto website. This automation runs every time something changes for the website –the automation itself can be found on GitHub. We use GitHub to subsequently make the website available onhttps://rdm.vu.nl. Pleaserefer to the Quarto documentation for detailed instructionson how to use Quarto.

#### Subtopic: Preview deployments
We use Netlify to automatically build previews of pull requests on GitHub. This is provided by Liberate Science GmbH, and is not critical to the operation ofhttps://rdm.vu.nl. It does, however, help the editors manage changes to the handbook. If this integration ever breaks, it can be fixed by one of the maintainers ofthe handbook repository. To fix this, link your GitHub repository through Netlify directly and it will automatically deploy any pull requests - https://app.netlify.com/start.

#### Subtopic: Easy GitHub contributor
The easy GitHub contributor is a small integration to make it easier to start contributing to the handbook. This service is provided by Liberate Science GmbH through Netlify. It is supported until September 1st, 2024 – after which it is no longer maintained.

#### Subtopic: Repository structure overview
Understanding the repository structure helps you locate and modify the right files:

#### Subtopic: Key files and directories
index.qmd- Homepage content _quarto.yml- Main Quarto configuration file _variables.yml- Site-wide variables and settings custom.scss- Custom styling contributing.qmd- Contributing guidelines editors-guide.qmd- Editor documentation The_quarto.ymlfile is especially important, as it contains the metadata and information to structure the handbook. You can use this to find and update the navigation bar. The specifics ofusing_quarto.ymlis documented very well by Quarto.

.qmdfiles- Quarto markdown files that combine markdown text with executable code YAML front matter- Configuration at the top of files between---markers Shortcodes- Special syntax for advanced features (e.g.,https://github.com/ubvu/open-handbook)

#### Subtopic: Useful resources
Quarto documentation Quarto guide for websites Markdown basics

#### Subtopic: Build errors
Error: “File not found”-Cause: Missing file reference or incorrect path -Solution: Check file paths in links and references -Can ignore in PR?No, this will break the build Error: “YAML parsing error”-Cause: Invalid YAML syntax in front matter or_quarto.yml-Solution: Check YAML indentation and syntax -Can ignore in PR?No, this will prevent building Error: “Duplicate anchor”-Cause: Multiple headings with the same text create duplicate IDs -Solution: Make heading text unique or use custom IDs -Can ignore in PR?Yes, but should be fixed for better navigation

#### Subtopic: Style issues
Info: “Missing alt text”-Cause: Images without alt text -Solution: Add descriptive alt text for accessibility -Can ignore in PR?Should be addressed for accessibility, but won’t break the build

#### Subtopic: Markdownlint errors
Markdownlint checks for consistent markdown formatting. This only runs if topics or guides are changed. Common errors include: MD001: Heading levels should only increment by one level at a time-Cause: Skipping heading levels (e.g., H1 directly to H3) -Solution: Use proper heading hierarchy -Escape: Add<!-- markdownlint-disable MD001 -->before the heading MD033: Inline HTML-Cause: Using HTML tags in markdown -Solution: Use markdown syntax instead, or use HTML when necessary -Escape: Add<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->around HTML sections -Can ignore in PR?Usually yes, HTML is sometimes needed for advanced formatting MD041: First line in file should be a top level heading-Cause: File doesn’t start with H1 heading -Solution: Add H1 heading or use YAML front matter -Escape: Add<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->at the top -Can ignore in PR?Yes, especially for files with YAML front matter The full set of rules can be found in themarkdownlint documentation.

#### Subtopic: How to disable Markdownlint rules
You can disable specific rules in a document in several ways: For a single line: For a section: For an entire file: In a .markdownlint.json config file: Please edit the existing.markdownlint.jsonfilein case you want to ignore certain rules project-wide.

### Topic: ADA HPC – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/ada.html

#### Subtopic: What is it?
ADA is a high performance compute (HPC) cluster for research at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. ADA is named in honour ofAda Lovelace, the pioneering mathematician and writer known for her work on Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation. ADA is the rebranded name of our previous cluster, BAZIS, and is maintained by the IT for Research team. ADA is a heterogenious cluster composed of partitions and servers financed by various VU research departments and the VU IT department. The cluster is particularly useful for executing multi-node computations that are not possible on the general VU compute servers but do not require the scale of the National Supercomputer, Snellius. ADA users are granted access to a set of compute partitions based on the resources owned by their research department. Users not affiliated with a research department that owns cluster hardware can get access to the community partition. A large collection of tools, compilers and libraries is available for your analysis, and your data onSciStorare directly accessible from ADA.

#### Subtopic: What can it be used for?
Most researchers start out by running their analysis tools on their laptop. The performance of a laptop is limited however. You might find your analysis takes up so many resources that your laptop becomes unusable for other tasks, or tasks take so long that you have to find a way to keep your laptop running overnight. For example a lot of AI tasks, such as running Large Language Models (LLMs), require a dedicated GPU, which most laptops don’t have. These tasks will run very slowly, or not at all. A next step might be purchasing a Workstation with more performance and maybe a GPU. You can run the same applications as your laptop and leave it running overnight and during weekends. The modern VU offices are not geared for workstations, however, so that might not be possible. The point where your laptop or even a workstation becomes unusable for your analysis workflow is when you should consider HPC. HPC nodes have a large amount of RAM, many processor cores and often multiple GPUs. HPC clusters work with a queueing system, meaning the system will wait until enough resources are available to run your job and it will run multiple jobs simultaneously so its resources are used optimally. Be aware that it is generally not possible to run graphical desktop applications (such as RStudio, SPSS or ArcGIS) on an HPC cluster. Your analysis needs to be able to run as a script that can be started from a Linux command line. This means there is a learning curve to use HPC, especially if you are not used to a Command-line Interface (CLI) and scripting. CLI and scripting skills are very useful to have for every researcher, but if you feel you do not have the time to learn these skills there might be other options available such asthe VU Compute HuborSURF Research Cloudwhere you can run some graphical tools.

#### Subtopic: GPUs in ADA
Some workloads, such as Machine Learning, require a GPU. At the moment only some of the compute nodes in the ADA community partition have GPUs, the availability is not sufficient for everyone at any given time. If your workload requires more extensive use of GPUs and your department has no dedicated compute nodes with GPUs, you can apply for access to the national HPC infrastructureSnelliusor considerbuying ADA compute nodeswith GPUs for your department.

#### Subtopic: How to request access
A form to request an account on ADA can be found on 🔒VU Service Portalunder IT > My work field > Research > HPC Cluster Computing > New ADA HPC Cluster Computing.

#### Subtopic: Are there costs involved?
The ADA cluster community nodes are free to use for VU researchers, although resources are limited.

#### Subtopic: Buying dedicated compute nodes
If your research projects require heavy usage of HPC you can consider spending part of your research budget to buy compute hardware for your group. Please contactIT for Researchfor more information on what is possible.

#### Subtopic: Getting started
You can find information on how to use ADA onada-hpc.readthedocs.io. Also take a look at theSURF wiki Snellius pages, they contain a lot of information that applies to ADA as well. SURF organises regular “Introduction to Supercomputing” training sessions, these are free to attend for VU researchers. The course is aimed at usingSnellius, but what you learn is applicable to ADA as well. Please consult theSURF Agendafor dates and registration.

### Topic: CARE Principles – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/care-principles.html

#### Subtopic: What are the CARE Principles?
The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance are a set of guidelines that complement the FAIR principles by focusing on people and purpose in data management, particularly for Indigenous data. CARE stands for Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics. These principles were developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance to ensure that data practices support Indigenous communities’ self-determination and promote equitable outcomes for Indigenous peoples. While originally developed for Indigenous data, the CARE principles have broader applicability to research involving any communities or populations, particularly those that have been historically marginalised or disadvantaged. They emphasise community engagement, ethical responsibility, and the importance of ensuring that data use benefits the communities from which data originate.

#### Subtopic: Collective Benefit
Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data. This is specified in the following ways: Inclusive development and innovation: Data should support Indigenous innovation and generate value for Indigenous communities. Use and reuse of databyIndigenous Peoples should be enabled and stimulated by governments and research institutions. Community value creation: Data ecosystems should be designed to support Indigenous communities’ self-determination and collective benefit, and to foster transparency, engagement and understanding between Indigenous Peoples and their (local) governments and policymakers. Equitable outcomes: Data use should promote equitable outcomes for Indigenous peoples and communities and contribute to Indigenous aspirations for wellbeing.

#### Subtopic: Authority to Control
Indigenous Peoples’ must have the right and authority to control their data and how they and information about them are represented in data. This is specified further as follows: Rights recognition: Indigenous Peoples have inherent rights and interests relating to Indigenous data and to individual and collective Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC). Data for governance: Indigenous Peoples have the right to (access to) data that empower their world-view, self-determination and self-governance. Governance of data: Indigenous Peoples have the right to determine what happens to their data.

#### Subtopic: Responsibility
Those working with Indigenous data are responsible for showing that the data use supports and benefits Indigenous Peoples. They also have to be transparent abouthowthe data are used. This is specified as follows: Positive relationships: Researchers and data users should build respectful, trusted and reciprocal relationships with Indigenous Communities. For expanding capability and capacity: Those working with the data should support Indigenous Peoples’ capacity to work with data capability to develop infrastructure for data. For Indigenous languages and worldviews: Those working with the data should provide resources that enable generating and collecting data in Indigenous languages and cultural contexts.

#### Subtopic: Ethics
Indigenous People’s rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern for data users during the entire data lifecycle. This is specified in the following points: Minimising harm and maximising benefit: Data use should minimise harm and risks to Indigenous communities and should be collected and used according to Indigenous Peoples’ frameworks. Benefits should be assessed based on Indigenous Peoples’ perspectives. Justice: Data practices should promote justice and representation for Indigenous Peoples Future use: Data governance must include considerations for future use and prevent potential futuremisuse of data according to the Indigenous People’s frameworks.

#### Subtopic: Implementation of the CARE principles
Like theFAIR principles, the CARE principles must be implemented consciously and conscientiously, and specific effort must be made to support them in research-performing institutions. That said, it is important to emphasise that thepurposeof the CARE principles is fundamentally different from the FAIR principles. The FAIR principles aim to promote transparency and maximum data reuse potential, which can create an image of data as a neutral, independent entity. Under the CARE principles, data collected by/with/about Indigenous Peoples are understood as fundamentallytied tothese Indigenous Peoples and the CARE principles underscore their ownership, authority and rights to the data. While data reuse can occur and/or be beneficial for Indigenous Peoples data, it is not always the best outcome or the primary aim. In thecontext of the Netherlandsresearch-performing institutions could consider the following to support researchers with implementing the CARE principles: Making researchers aware of the CARE principles and helping them to find resources for their application in their field. Supporting international working groups and alliances that develop the CARE principles further, such as theGlobal Indigenous Data Allianceand the Research Data Alliance (RDA’s)International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group. Making Indigenous data FAIR, bearing in mind the considerations outlined above. Applying the CARE principles to their own collections and services.

#### Subtopic: Indigenous data in university (library) collections
Universities and other research-performing institutions may already be holding data concerning Indigenous Peoples, whether they be research data or archives or objects in a university library’s (special) collections. This means that universities and university libraries have responsibilities with regards to the CARE principles. Where research data are concerned, it is mostly important to ensure that free, prior and informed consent was given for the data to be collected and/or published, and that the data were also initially shared with the Indigenous People from which they originated. At VU Amsterdam, data stewards already have experience with similar processes around (regular) personal data. If you find that you are working with, or your department holds datasets to which the CARE principles apply, and you have questions about how they should be handled, your first point of contact may be theRDM Support Deskor your faculty’s data steward. Library (special) collections may also require some care, especially if researchers would like to use them. At the 2025 LIBER Conference in Lausanne (Switzerland) a roundtable comprising of librarians who specialise in Indigenous Knowledges and/or had an Indigenous background discussed the ways libraries can incorporate Indigenous Knowledges and collections in their services while taking the CARE principles into account. The roundtable highlighted the fact that Indigenous Peoples may historically not have been included in libraries’ collection development and collection access, and that due to a historical legacy of colonialism and racism, existing library catalogues may contain terms and descriptions that are inaccurate, offensive and harmful. The roundtable further raised that library staff need to be more aware of these issues in managing their collections. To actively engage with some of these concerns, the VU University Library started aprojectto revisit descriptions of works in the library catalogue through the lens of decolonisation. In this way, the project tries to contribute to a more inclusive library environment for diverse users.

#### Subtopic: Sources and resources
The definitions of the CARE principles were taken from: Research Data Alliance International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group. (September 2019). “CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.” The Global Indigenous Data Alliance. GIDA-global.org. More in-depth information can be found there. The recommendations for implementation of the CARE principles were taken from: Carroll, S.R., Herczog, E., Hudson, M. et al. Operationalizing the CARE and FAIR Principles for Indigenous data futures.Sci Data8, 108 (2021).https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00892-0. Practical examples of implementation of the CARE principles are given in: Carroll, S, et al. 2020. The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.Data Science Journal, 19: XX, pp. 1–12. DOI:https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-042. Theprogrammeof the 2025 LIBER Conference, with the description of the roundtable on page 158.

#### Subtopic: Citation File Format (CFF) – Research Support Handbook
Citation File Format (CFF) – Research Support Handbook A Citation File Format (CFF) is a computer file that contains all information needed to cite something. For example, a dataset or a piece of software. Several data and software repositories, such as Zenodo and GitHub, support this format and enable others to easily select the citation information in their preferred format. Most reference managers can work with these standardized citation files, and automatically format the references in a document. A screenshot of the interface to cite a GitHub repository An example, CFF-file is given below, but to enable you to easily create a CFF-file you can use this website . cff-version : 1.2.0 message : "If you use this data, please cite it as below." authors : - family-names : Druskat given-names : Stephan orcid : https://orcid.org/1234-5678-9101-1121 title : "My Research Software" version : 2.0.4 identifiers : - type : doi value : 10.5281/zenodo.1234 date-released : 2021-08-11

### Topic: Data Archiving – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-archiving.html

#### Subtopic: What is data archiving?
When we mentiondata archivingat VU Amsterdam, we mean the following: Creation of a secure and immutable copy of research data, associated metadata, accompanying documentation, and software code (where relevant) with the intention to ensure (conditional) access for a predetermined, minimum, period of time. As stated in theResearch Data and Software Management Policy, researchers are responsible for archiving all research data and software that leads to a published result (either in an article or other narrative form) in a trusted repository for a period of at least ten years after this publication, unless legal requirements, discipline-specific guidelines or contractual arrangements dictate otherwise.

#### Subtopic: Purpose
Data archiving is crucial for enabling verification of research data. Verification is important for a transparent research practice, a value VU Amsterdam is strongly committed to. Archiving your data ensures that data will be preserved for the long term and that data can be accessed if necessery, even when the Principal Investigator or other members of the research team are no longer available at VU Amsterdam.

#### Subtopic: Requirements
At VU Amsterdam, we strive to make our research dataFAIR. When datasets are archived in a repository provided by VU Amsterdam (YodaorDataverseNL, the following requirements apply: the data must be provided with Metadata according to theVU Minimal metadata guide; the data and software must have aPersistent identifier(or Identifiers) to increase findability; a licence must be applied to the data and software in order to indicate if it can be reused by others and if so, under which conditions. If you use an external repository, these requirements are useful to keep in mind as well, because they make the data FAIR to a large extent, but in that case you will have to rely on the properties of the repository.

#### Subtopic: How does data archiving work in practice?
As mentioned above, data archiving must happen in a repository. This means that data storage solutions for during research, like Research Drive, are not suitable for data archiving. They don’t generate aPersistent Identifierand do not ask for metadata or a licence. Detailed workflows addressing archiving data can be found in the guides aboutmaking your data FAIRandarchiving and publishing data.

### Topic: Data Backup – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-backup.html

#### Subtopic: Why backup?
Hard drives fail, computers get stolen or lost, or your data may accidentally get deleted. To avoid data loss, backing up your data regularly is essential. Ideally, you should have your data stored in at least two, but ideally three different locations. Most cloud-based tools will automatically handle backup for you, but they don’t protect you from your own mistakes. If you work with data that cannot be easily recreated or recalculated and ensure that it is sufficiently backed up withthe 3-2-1 rule. This is especially important when migrating your data, such as when updating your operating system to a new major version, or when you get a new computer.

#### Subtopic: 3-2-1 Rule
The 3-2-1 rule states that you should have: 3 Copies of your data 2 Different mediums (2 different kinds of storage) 1 Copy is kept off-site Ideally, this is automated so that you as a user do not have to manually do anything extra to manage your data. If possible, automate this backup as well with computer scheduling tools such as Task Scheduler (Windows) or Crontab (Linux). Note that the VU-supported storage solutions (SciStor, Research Drive and Yoda) have enough safeguards to satisfy the 3-2-1 rule. Storing your data on one of these platforms plus a working copy on your laptop, if needed, is sufficient.

#### Subtopic: Simple Synchronising Solutions
The VU provides access to multiplestorage systems. You may use a mix of the different platforms. Some of these tools are able to automatically synchronise your data to the cloud: Teams, Onedrive and Research Drive. Check regularly if all the relevant data folders are indeed still synchronised. If you accidentally delete a file, you can restore your folder to a previous date - various systems will have different retention periods but it is usually around 1 month.

#### Subtopic: Data rentention for VU data storage platforms
OneDrive: if you’re signed in with a work or school account, items in the recycle bin are automatically deleted after 93 days. The files can be restored to OneDrive before then, or you can permanently delete them from your OneDrive. Additionally, you can restore your OneDrive to a state from the previous 29 days. Finally, the university has an additional backup of data, which can be accessed in case of emergency. However, no rights can be derived for the emergency backup. Snellius: Not all of the filesystems on Snellius are backed up automatically, most notably the Project and Scratch spaces. Your home folder is backed up however. You can find more information on theSnellius website. SciStor: Depending on the agreements of your department, data may be backed up. Please check with your department cluster manager. Research Drive: The Research Drive is backed up daily by SURF. Yoda: Yoda is backed up daily by SURF.

#### Subtopic: Notes
Make sure the backup storage is suitable if your data are (privacy) sensitive. TheData Storage Findercan help you select the right tool. If you backup sensitive data to a USB drive make sure to encrypt it, for example with a tool likeCryptomator. Utrecht University Geo Data Team Servicesprovide a detailed page on data backup including a discussion of data selection for backup. When your laptop and hard drive are in the same bag, the “backup” can easily get lost along with the primary data and there is thus no proper backup. These are just some tips, please take responsibility over your data and make sure they are protected from loss but also from your own mistakes.

### Topic: Data Citation – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-citation.html

#### Subtopic: Citation Elements
Citing data is not different from citing a journal publication. Similar to citing a journal publication, it helps to give and receive credit, and show the impact of the original source. Make sure to check the rules of the journal to know how you should cite when writing an article for a specific academic journal. For all of the journals, however, the minimum compulsory elements in a data citation include: Author(s): Name of the author (creator) of the dataset Title: Name of the dataset Date of publication Publisher: Archive where dataset is stored Persistent Identifier: Unique identifier, most common is the DOI (see sectionPersistent Identifier). Optional elements that may be included in the reference are: File Type: Codebook, movie, software Version: Version number of the edition Creation Date Date of Consultation (last) If you (re)used another, openly accessible datasetto create your own, it is also important to (first check that the original dataset’s licence permits this and to) cite that dataset correctly. If you want to make clear in a journal article that another dataset was reused, you can add this information, including a citation to the original dataset, to the data availability statement, besides the reference list. In your own dataset, you can use theREADME fileto cite the original dataset and explain how it was reused. You should also add documentation about what processing you did to the original dataset to create your own, and refer to this documentation in the README file. Many repositories prescribe a standard way to cite datasets for several citation styles, and one can very often simply copy and paste that. For example, Zenodo has a citation box on the bottom right of the page, and there one can choose a citation style and simply copy that or export the citation to a citation file (which is useful if you are using EndNote or Zotero). The same can be done in Datacite (example).

### Topic: Data Classification – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-classification.html

#### Subtopic: Data Classification
The purpose of classifying data is to assess the risks associated with the data in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, and to determine a suitable level of protection. Classifying research data enables researchers to protect the data in an appropriate manner. What is relevant, is that the security level matches the identified risks. This enables the researcher to determine where the data may or may not be processed and under which conditions. A data classification addresses risks relating to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. For the research domain, Confidentiality is the crucial aspect in many cases. Examples of data that are classified as confidential are personal data (as defined in theGeneral Data Protection Regulation), commercially or politically sensitive data and data under protection of a non-disclosure agreement. If you work with these types of data, it is necessary to classify your data. You can address the classification of your data in yourData Management Plan(DMP) and use theData Classification Tool(see below) as a starting point.

#### Subtopic: Data Classification Tool
TheData Classification Toolwill help assess the risks associated with research data and provide feedback on what measures need to be undertaken to protect the data. The tool assesses the three risk categories i.e., Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, by asking whether certain conditions apply to the data. Each category has an “i” which provides for more explanation on each condition. The first category (Confidentiality) is relevant to privacy or other data that needs to be kept confidential. The other two categories relate to the impacts of data losses (Availability) and inappropriate alterations or corruption (Integrity). Once all relevant boxes under each category have been checked, a tile will be highlighted. This tile contains further details about the data-related risks and describes the steps that should be taken. You can save the results of the risk assessment by pressing the “Export” button. This will produce a PDF, including the links. The result you get is not a formal data classification, although it will be sufficient for many projects with low and medium risks. The information from the assessment can be used forDMPs,Data Protection Impact Assessments(DPIAs) or full (formal) classification. You can also use it to find a suitable storage location for your data through theData Storage Finder. One of the filters in the Data Storage Finder is called ‘Data classification’, which refers to the level of ‘Confidentiality’ from a data classification. Note that because the risks may vary for different types of data, you should repeat this process for each type of data you will use in your research. For example, a research project with multiple datasets, will require numerous risk assessments.

#### Subtopic: Policy Classification of Research Data
ThePolicy Classification of Research Datacontains more information about classifying research data in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. It also explains how the classification process should be carried out. The Research Data Classification Policy will determine what level of security measures are necessary to manage data securely. The document contains tables with practical information relating to information security: examples of data for the various levels of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability; a list of standard security measures per aspect; an overview of research data management tools and what types of data are allowed in these systems; an overview of what research data management tool is suitable in which situation.

#### Subtopic: Knowledge Security
One factor that has become more prominent for data classification in recent years is knowledge security. While data classification and knowledge security are different concepts, the degree to which knowledge security applies to a research project and its data also influences the eventual classification of the data, particularly in the case of research into dual use items. You can find more information about knowledge security, the VU’s implementation of a Knowledge Security Framework and the definition of dual use items on theKnowledge Security pagein this handbook.

### Topic: Data Collection – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-collection.html

#### Subtopic: Data Collection Tools
The tools being used in research to collect data are immensely diverse. For that reason, we will not provide an exhaustive overview here. What is important for data collection tools in relation to RDM is where such tools store the data that you collect and in which format. The storage location is particularly important when you are working with personal data. For example, the privacy legislation in the United States is very different from the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Hence, personal data collected in a Dutch research institute may not be stored on American servers. It is important to keep that in mind when you are contemplating which tool to use for your data collection. If you are collecting personal data and you decide to use a tool for which no contract exists between VU Amsterdam and the provider of the software or tool, a service agreement and a processing agreement must be drawn up. Contact the 🔒privacy championof your faculty for more information and a model processing agreement.

#### Subtopic: Questionnaire tools
The Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences has developed adocument with tips for safe useof the questionnaire tools Qualtrics and Survalyzer. The document was made for FGB researchers specifically but can also be helpful for others. Consult this document if you need a questionnaire tool to collect your data.

#### Subtopic: Data Collection in Collaboration
Some research projects involve the participation of multiple organisations or institutes and may include even cross-border co-operation. When data is collected by several organisations, a Data Management Plan should provide information on who is responsible for which part of the data collection and storage. It should also provide information on how specific data collections are related to which part(s) of the research goal(s). Describing this precisely will help you to determine if a consortium agreement or joint controller agreement is necessary. You see a general example of such a specification in the table below:

#### Subtopic: Data Collection Protocols
Regardless of the field of study or preference for defining data (quantitative, qualitative), accurate data collection is essential to maintaining the integrity (structure) of research. Both the selection of appropriate data collection instruments (existing, modified, or newly developed) and clearly delineated instructions for their correct use reduce the likelihood of errors. There are two approaches for reducing and/or detecting errors in data which can help to preserve the integrity of your data and ensure scientific validity. These are: Quality assurance- activities that take placebeforedata collection begins Quality control- activities that take placeduring and afterdata collection Quality assurance precedes data collection and its main focus is ‘prevention’ (i.e., forestalling problems with data collection). Prevention is the most cost-effective activity to ensure the integrity of data collection. This proactive measure is best demonstrated by the standardization of protocol developed in a comprehensive and detailed procedures manual for data collection. While quality control activities (detection/monitoring and action) occur during and after data collection, the details should be carefully documented in the procedures manual. A clearly defined communication structure is a necessary pre-condition for monitoring and tracking down errors. Quality control also identifies the required responses, or ‘actions’ necessary to correct faulty data collection practices and also minimise future occurrences. Some sources for protocols: HANDSHandbook for Adequate Natural Data Stewardship by the Federation of Dutch University Medical Centers (UMCs) Protocols.io- an open access repository of protocols Springer Protocols- free and subscribed protocols collected by Springer.

### Topic: Data Documentation – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-documentation.html

#### Subtopic: FAIR data principles
The FAIR data principles provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability, i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention. More information can be found in the section about theFAIR data principles.

#### Subtopic: Unstructured metadata
Most data documentation is an example of unstructured metadata. Unstructured metadata are mainly intended to provide more detailed information about the data and is primarily readable for humans. The type of research and the nature of the data influence what kind of unstructured metadata is necessary. Unstructured metadata are attached to the data in a file. The format of the file is chosen by the researcher. More explanation about structured metadata can be found on themetadata page.

#### Subtopic: README
A README file provides information about data and is intended to ensure that data can be correctly interpreted, by yourself or by others. A README file is required whenever you are archiving or publishing data. Example of READMEs Guidelines for creating a README file – 4TU.ResearchData Guide to writing “readme”-style metatada - Cornell Data Services Guidelines for researchers of VU Amsterdam Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences on what a README file should contain

#### Subtopic: Codebook
A Codebook is another way to describe the contents, structure and layout of the data. A well documented codebook is intended to be complete and self-explanatory and contains information about each variable in a data file. A codebook must be submitted along with the data. There are several guides for creating a codebook available: Creating a codebook - Kent State University Creating a codebook - for researchers at VU Amsterdam Faculty for Behavioural and Movement Sciences Codebook - Amsterdam Public Health DDI-Codebook - Data Documentation Initiative Alliance

### Topic: Data Licensing – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-licensing.html

#### Subtopic: Introduction
A data licence agreement is a legal instrument that lets others know what they can and cannot do with a particular dataset (and any documentation, scripts and metadata that are published with the data - information about software licensing can be found on thesoftware licensingpage). It is important to consider what kind of limitations are relevant. Usually, at least the following questions are considered: Can people make copies or even distribute copies? Do others (and you) reusing the dataset need to acknowledge you as the author of the original dataset? (This is called Attribution.) Do others (and you) who reuse the dataset and/or make derivatives of the dataset need to share their work under a similar licence? (This is called Share-Alike.) Can others (and you) use your dataset commercially? (A restriction on commercial use is called Non-Commercial.) Can others (and you) create a new work based on the dataset? (This is called a Derivative.) The considerations above are the ‘building blocks’ thatCreative Commons licencesuse. There are also other considerations, and also other licences.

#### Subtopic: Reusing existing data
If you wish to reuse data collected by others (this could be data you received from for example Statistics Netherlands or from a company, a dataset you have found in an online repository, commonly used databases for which VU Amsterdam has a licence, etc.), make sure that you read the licence or terms of use. Also make sure that you work with the data according to the licence or terms of use. This can mean different things depending on the licence, but common things to consider are for example: cite the data in an appropriate manner; do not share the data beyond the project/purpose for which you received them; share the outcome of your research based on the data under a similar licence; only use them for scientific purposes (and not for commercial purposes, for example). If you have questions about the legal context of using an existing dataset, you can contact theRDM Support Deskor the legal experts atIXA VU.

#### Subtopic: Licensing data
If you want to makeyour dataavailable for other (research) purposes, it is important to apply a licence to it. Without a licence, it is impossible for others to reuse your data without your explicit approval. When you deposit your data in a repository, the repository will usually ask you to select a standard licence, or to create and add a custom licence yourself. If you need help with drawing up licence agreements, you can contact theVU’s legal office.

#### Subtopic: DataverseNL
InDataverseNLyou can choose your terms of use when uploading data to the repository. TheDataverseNL user guideexplains how licensing works in the repository.

#### Subtopic: Yoda
If you publish your data in Yoda, there isguidanceavailable on how to choose a licence and how to customise licences.

#### Subtopic: Open Science Framework (OSF)
In OSF, you can apply a standard licence to your materials or upload your own custom licence. TheOSF user guideexplains both options.

#### Subtopic: External repositories
Some data repositories require you to use a certain licence if you want to deposit your data with them. AtDryad, for example, all datasets are published under the terms ofCreative Commons Zeroto minimise legal barriers and to maximise the impact for research and education. Some funders may also require that you publish the data as open data.Open dataare data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share alike (Open Knowledge International definition).

### Topic: Data Management Plan (DMP) – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-management-plan.html

#### Subtopic: What is a DMP
A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document outlining how research data will be handled throughout the research life cycle. A DMP is a structured way to address data collection, organization, storage, sharing, and preservation. It also outlines the measures taken to ensure data security and addresses how data will be preserved and made available for future use.

#### Subtopic: DMPonline
VU Amsterdam offers the online toolDMPonlinefor writing Data Management Plans. DMPonline is a platform that offers a range of templates, ensuring that researchers can create DMPs to meet the standards of diverse funders and institutions associated with their projects. DMPonline makes it easy to work on a DMP together with colleagues, advisors, or other stakeholders. VU Amsterdam researchers can use therequest feedbackfunction of DMPonline to get their DMP reviewed by a faculty data steward or RDM Support Desk colleague. Instructions for selecting the right DMP template in DMPonline are available in theguide How can you set up research data management from the start?. If you have questions about DMPonline, or encounter problems when using the tool, please get in touch withrdm@vu.nl.

#### Subtopic: What is data
Research data is any information that has been collected, observed, generated or created to validate original research findings. Examples of data could be interview recordings, experiment results, physical measurement, notes from focus group’s meetings, notes from fieldwork, observations captured in photographs, film or audio, text files extracted from a corpus, image of archival items or artworks, scraped websites, responses to survey questions. Algorithms, simulations, code, scripts and software are often also considered as research data. There is also physical data: (biological) samples, collections, artifacts etc. Administrative documents, like informed consent forms and key files should be acknowledged as important elements of research data as well.

#### Subtopic: Data Assets
At VU Amsterdam, we sometimes use the term ‘Data Assets’. You can think of data assets as small ‘parcels’ of data that can change form or format throughout the research. For example, if you’re sending out surveys for your research, the survey responses are considered a data asset. If, in addition to the surveys, you’re also holding focus groups, the data collected from the focus group are also considered a data asset, separate from the survey results. Most projects will have more than one data asset per data stage. It is common to provide data assets based on the data stage such as raw, processed, or analysed. Raw Data refers to original data collected, Processed Data is data that has undergone some level of transformation or organisation. Processing involves cleaning, formatting, and structuring raw data to make them more understandable and suitable for analysis. Analysed Data usually results from statistical methods, detailed examination or interpretation. Here are some examples of data assets in research data management: Note that these data assets also change in the different phases of the research! While the interview data are audio files in the raw stage, they are transcribed and become text files in the processed stage.

#### Subtopic: DMP Elements
VU Amsterdam DMP template consists of seven sections with questions. In DMPonline, there is guidance available for all sections, as well as example answers. When you are writing your DMP, you can consult this information directly in DMPonline. Below we provide references to information and support available for various RDM-related aspects.

#### Subtopic: Legal and ethical requirements
If you have questions about working with personal data in research, please get in touch with the Privacy Champion of your faculty. The 🔒overview of Privacy Championscan be found on VU Amsterdam website. Make sure to contact your Privacy Champion in the following situations: If you need to carry out a DPIA, or if you’re unsure if you need to do one If you work with special category personal data, or otherwise very sensitive data If you are collaborating with other parties If you need software for which no licence is set up on behalf of VU Amsterdam If you wish to reuse existing data containing personal data It is impossible to provide an overview of tasks to be carried out to ensure compliance with the GDPR that fits all research projects. For that reason, it is important to contact your Privacy Champion. They will be able to identify what needs to be arranged to adhere to the GDPR. In cases where research involves human or animal participants, a research proposal may need to be reviewed by an ethics committee. VU Amsterdam and Amsterdam UMC (location VUmc), have several ethics committees, which are listed below. Please note that researchers at VU Amsterdam also have to go to the METc at VUmc if their research issubject to the WMO, which is not restricted to research at VUmc.

### Topic: Data Protection – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-protection.html

#### Subtopic: What is Data Protection?
Protection from what? From whom? When, and why? Before we talk about data protection, let us consider security first. More often than not, ‘security’ is regarded as a fixed state. In reality, security is an assessment of the level of protection against a certain threat, that you consider to deal with that threat adequately enough. Whether or not security is accurate depends on the value of the data and the quality of protective measures. The question for you as a researcher is ‘when are the measures that you take secure enough?’. In order to answer this, please be aware that there are three entities that have an opinion about what is ‘secure enough’, namely: the law, the University, and you yourself as the data processor. The University has a Security Baseline that sets a norm for levels of protection for every application it uses. The Baseline is based on international standards. For each of these applications, the University is considering for which means the security of these applications are adequate enough. The legal requirements for the processing of personal data can be found in the section ‘GDPR and Privacy’ underPlan & DesignThere are additional laws and regulations as well. The assumption is that you are familiar with these, especially with laws regulating medical and criminal research. What you personally consider to be secure might be very different from what your colleagues, the Faculty or the University considers to be secure enough and the norms will vary with the variety of data that is being processed by different researchers and Faculties of VU Amsterdam. Very generally speaking, there are three points of protection to consider: Protection against data loss, for which you need a back up periodically. Protection against data leakage, for which you need to consider all storage places and their access points. Protection of data integrity, for which you need version control and synchronisation management. The security of your protection measures depends on the threat you face. We often think of threats as active, and motivated by bad intentions. But most common forms of data loss are accidental and most leakage is caused by trusting others. In reality, devices just get lost or break down, people download malware by accident, and each one of us forgets to save a document at times or gets confused about which version was last updated. In all cases, protection starts with oversight on where your data is stored and processed. If you forget that you temporarily stored it in a certain place, you have then lost oversight of where that data is. The opposite is also true: if you know where you data is, you have insight in the level of security of the space in which you store it. As you can see, protection begins with organising your work in a reliable manner and thinking through your steps. For example, if you data is on your laptop and synchronised with your phone, then it is stored in two places. Perhaps this is enough back up, perhaps not. If you put both you devices in the same bag and you lose your bag, you have no backup. A backup to an online storage might be a good solution, but might also mean your data leaks via the internet of via the storage provider who sells the data and your behavioural data for profit. Most importantly, there is no absolute security. It is best if you consider your personal behaviour and then think of scenarios that are more or less likely to happen and what would impact you most. If you frequently work in public places you should make it a habit to lock your device each time you leave it. If you eat and drink behind your desk often, better work with a remote keyboard to protect your laptop from the unavoidable coffee shower. Do you save your respondents’ contact details on your personal phone? Then protect it with a pin. Here are some basic protection guidelines: Data are very difficult to erase. You have probably never done it. Decide how to back up data and test it before you rely on it. Do not give others your log-in credentials. If you have done so and your family members use your work device, then change it. Do not use passwords twice, do not use your birthday, initials, streetname, hobby. Encryption sounds secure, but it fails completely without good password management.

#### Subtopic: Data Protection
There can be many reasons why the data of a project needs to be kept protected: Sensitivity of the data collected Protection of the research data from competition Commercial reasons / Intellectual property Etc. There are also many levels of security that may be implemented, depending on the needs. Sometimes it will be enough to use a password-protected cloud-based server. In extreme cases encryption may be needed and also when data is transmitted between researchers or organisations. You should contact theRDM Support Deskto discuss available options, who may connect you to legal experts where sensitive data is concerned. Check theData Storage topicfor links to find out more on campus solutions and cloud-based options. See also theSafe Data Transfertopic for more information on how to transport and transfer data.

### Topic: Data Publishing – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-publishing.html

#### Subtopic: What is data publishing?
When we mentiondata publishingat VU Amsterdam, we mean the following: Making research data, associated metadata, accompanying documentation, and software code (where relevant) accessible in a repository in such a manner thatthey can be discovered on the Webandreferred to in a unique and persistent way(Inspired by the definition in theCODATA Research Data Management Terminology). As stated in theResearch Data and Software Management Policy, researchers are responsible for publishing all research data that leads to a published result (either in an article or other narrative form) for scientific reuse, meaning that these materials can be discovered on the Web and referred to in a unique and persistent way. This means that the existence of a dataset is announced and that basic information about this dataset (like title, creator, moment of publication, etc.) can be found online, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that others will be able to access and download the actual data. The level of accessibility to the data must be determined during the publication process. If data or software contain confidential information, information to which intellectual properties apply, and/or personal data, an assessment must take place to determine whether these data can be made available for reuse and if so, under which conditions. A custom licence (‘restricted’ or ‘closed’) will indicate if conditional access can be granted, and if so, what the conditions are.

#### Subtopic: Purpose
Data publishing is crucial for the accessibility of research output. It helps to make VU Amsterdam’s research visible, verifiable and, where possible, reusable. These are important goals for VU Amsterdam, as they contribute to a transparent reseach practice and enable other researchers to build on work that has been done by VU researchers. Publishing data means that researchers make their datasets known to the world, even if they cannot be accessed by others directly, but only after granting conditional access. This enables other researchers reusing these data, leading to more impact of research that is carried out at VU Amsterdam. It may also result in new collaborations. Another advantage is that it makes the work of a researcher more visible, going beyond the visibility of a publication alone.

#### Subtopic: Requirements
At VU Amsterdam, we strive to make our research dataFAIR. Publishing data is a crucial step in making data findable. As explained in the definition above, publishing means that you make data discoverable on the internet. As a result, other researchers can find out about the existence of your dataset and consider whether it may be useful for them in their own research. Apersistent identifierhelps in making data findable, because it ensures that the persistent identifier always resolves to the correct digital object. Richmetadataalso contribute to the findability of a dataset. The more information you provide, the more likely it is that others will be able to find your dataset. It is beneficial to use terminology that is common in your discipline when filling out the metadata fields in a repository. Rich information about your dataset will also help other researchers determine whether your dataset is potentially relevant for them. Repositories provided by VU Amsterdam (YodaandDataverseNL) will generate aPersistent Identifierfor your dataset and they will ask you to fill outmetadatafields. In this way, they contribute to making your data findable. This will also be the case for external trusted repositories. When you publish your data, it is important to apply alicenceto it. If you don’t do that, others will not be allowed to reuse your data. A licence is a legal instrument that tells others what they can and cannot do with your data and is therefore an important aspect of making data reusable.

#### Subtopic: How does data publishing work in practice?
As mentioned above, data publishing must happen through a repository. Detailed workflows addressing publishing data can be found in the guides aboutmaking your data FAIRandarchiving and publishing data.

Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-registration.html

#### Subtopic: Register your Data in PURE
Just like your publications, data that you have collected for your research constitutes research output, too. Therefore you are required to record your data in PURE.1Your data can be of interest to others, which can in turn lead to new collaboration opportunities. Data recorded in PURE also appear in reports that are used for research evaluations. Even if access to your data is closed, you are required to register your data in PURE. It is a record of the research, data collection and analysis that you have carried out.

### Topic: Data Storage – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/data-storage.html

#### Subtopic: Storage During Research
VU Amsterdam offers several options to store your research data. The choice for a specific option may depend on factors such as: Does a project involve multiple organisations or departments? The sensitivity of the data: does it involve personal data or copyrighted / commercial data? Are there any research partners with whom data need to be shared? Are any commercial parties involved? Does the research project involve multiple locations (inside or maybe even outside the EU)? Will there be (lab) devices producing data that need to be stored as well? What will be the volume of the data? Will there be lots of interactions with the data (using software/tools)? Storage options may take several forms, for example: Local storage on computers, networks or servers; Cloud storage offered by VU Amsterdam; Locations where physical data samples are stored (fridges, lockers, etc.). Researchers, including PhD candidates, have multiple options that can be used, some of which are listed below. More information about these storage options is available behind their respective links. TheStorage finderis a tool that will give you a number of storage options suitable for your research. For more individual guidance, please get in touch with theResearch Data Management Support Deskfor advice, particularly when you are working with commercial, personal or otherwise sensitive data, or when you have a complex IT setup.

#### Subtopic: Standard services offered by VU Amsterdam
VU IT offers several services for employees to store their files. Examples are: 🔒OneDrive: personal storage for all VU employees and part of the Microsoft 365 platform. OneDrive allows you to store files locally and in the Microsoft cloud, and share folders and documents with colleagues. Since this is personal storage, tied to someone’s personal VU account, we don’t usually recommend storing research data in OneDrive: if the account holder leaves VU Amsterdam, the account and all the data on it, disappear. 🔒OneDrive: personal storage for all VU employees and part of the Microsoft 365 platform.

#### Subtopic: Research data-specific storage options
The options above are standard data storage options at VU Amsterdam to which all employees have access. But VU Amsterdam also offers storage specifically for research data. Some of them are hosted locally at VU Amsterdam, while others are SURF cloud services. When selecting a cloud-based service it is important to remember to checkwherethe data will be hosted. If the research project involves sensitive data it may be necessary to choose cloud-based options that guarantee that the data will stay in the EEA or on servers based in the EEA. 🔒SciStor(short for ‘Storage for Scientists’): This is storage hosted by IT for Research (ITvO) and allows for inexpensive storage of large volumes of data. There are various levels of security possible and various ways to get access to the files.

Costs for each of these storage options are detailed on theVU website, including details on how the costs are calculated and billed.

#### Subtopic: Sending research data to partners
Some projects may require data sharing with partners. Although Research Drive and Yoda support sharing data all through the project, it may also be the case that some data only need to be sent to a partner once. There are some secure options to send data to research partners: 🔒Surf Filesender: cloud service that allows you to send files of 1 Terabyte to other researchers and encrypted files of up to 250 GB. 🔒Surf Filesender: cloud service that allows you to send files of 1 Terabyte to other researchers and encrypted files of up to 250 GB. 🔒Zivver: All employees of VU Amsterdam can use Zivver, the encryption programme that allows you to send email or data (sensitive or otherwise) securely by email.

### Topic: DataverseNL – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/dataversenl.html

#### Subtopic: What is it?
DataverseNLis an Open Access dataset archiving and publication platform used by various institutions. VU Amsterdam has a section for each faculty to archive and publish their datasets. DataverseNL helps the researcher make their data “FAIR” by providing a solution that enables data discovery and sharing (i.e., findable, accessible). In addition, it facilitates the use of metadata, contributing to data interoperability and reusability. DataverseNL provides a platform for the implementation of standard workflows that can ensure metadata quality satisfyingVU policy requirementsfor data archiving and publication. Many research institutions and funding organisations (such as NWO and ZonMw) require researchers to make their data FAIR. DataverseNL is open source software developed and maintained byHarvard University. The Dutch version is hosted byDANS.

#### Subtopic: What can it be used for?
DataverseNL is a simple method to archive and publish datasets. Through the platform it becomes very easy to share data and documents from your research. The platforms generates a webpage displaying your data and accompanying metadata, and a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) which enables increased visibility and quick references to your dataset. It is possible to make files within your dataset only accessible on request. Please note that DataverseNL is only suitable for archiving and publishing datasets that do not contain personal data or other types of confidential data. Even though access to data files in DataverseNL can be restricted, datasets containing personal data or other types of confidential data must not be uploaded to DataverseNL. A suitable repository for archiving and publishing personal and sensitive data isYoda.

#### Subtopic: Data storage
DataverseNL is a Cloud storage solution that can be used for small to large datasets. The datasets are preserved through backup copies of the data.

#### Subtopic: Data sharing
Through the generated DOI you can make your dataset easy to find and access. You can reference it in your publications and through your profile page on theVU Research Portal(PURE).

#### Subtopic: Sensitive data
Although DataverseNL is meant for Open Access datasets, it is possible to restrict access to particular files. This means it is possible to archive medium sensitive (anonymised) data. As explained above, personal data or other types of confidential data that score High or Very High on confidentiality (see thePolicy Classification of Research Dataand theResearch Data Classification Tool) must not be uploaded to DataverseNL. Data that score High or Very High on confidentiality can be archived and published inYoda.

#### Subtopic: Metadata
You can add descriptive metadata to a dataset draft in DataverseNL. After publication of the dataset it is still possible to alter the metadata, but this will result in a new version of the dataset. If you feel metadata fields are missing, a request can be sent to SURF to add these fields. The requirement for this change is that the added metadata fields are part of an internationally recognised dataset metadata scheme.

#### Subtopic: Uploading data
All VU employees can create an account in DataverseNL and upload and publish datasets. When you wish to upload data to DataverseNL, it is important to select your faculty or department. If you want to upload your dataset as part of a certain department, and your department is not yet included in DataverseNL, you can contact the DataverseNL manager to request your department to be added. You can use the Contact button in DataverseNL to submit such a request.

#### Subtopic: Viewing and reusing data
Data that are publicly available, are visible and downloadable for everyone. If a dataset includes files with restricted access, people interested in the data have to create an account in DataverseNL to be able to request access to those files. The contact person for the dataset needs to grant access in order for others to use the data.

#### Subtopic: Are there costs involved?
The costs for archiving datasets for the required period stated in theResearch Data and Software Management Policyare currently covered through the Cost Recharge Model (KDM). The details can be found in the 🔒Research Archiving & Storage Cost Model.

#### Subtopic: Getting Started
The DataverseNL website has practical information in theirUser Guide.

### Topic: FAIR Principles – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/fair-principles.html

#### Subtopic: What are the FAIR principles?
The FAIR principles were formulated in 2016 to guide researchers in increasing theFindability,Accessibility,Interoperability andReusability of their data (see thepublicationin the journal Scientific Data and thesummaryof the principles). The goal is to ensure that scholarly data can be used as widely as possible – accelerating scientific discoveries and benefiting society in the process. A lot of good resources exist already that explain the FAIR principles very well: GO FAIRprovides a clear overview of the FAIR principles The Turing Wayhas a great information page about FAIR, containing a lot of references to other useful sources The storyA FAIRy taleexplains all principles in an understable way The FAIR principles were rapidly adopted by Dutch and European funding agencies. If you receive a research grant fromNWO,ZonMw, or theEuropean Commission, you will be asked to make your data FAIR.

#### Subtopic: How can you benefit from working in line with the FAIR principles?
You do not need to apply all FAIR principles at once to start benefiting from making your data FAIR. Applying even just some of the principles will increase the visibility and impact of your data, leading to: Increased citations of the datasets themselves and your research Improved reproducibility of your research Compliance with funder and publisher requirements Making your data FAIR will also make it possible for you to easily find, access and reuse your own data in the future. You may be the first and most important beneficiary of making your own data FAIR.

#### Subtopic: Start with a data management plan
A DMP is a living document in which you specify what kinds of data you will use in your project, and how you will process, store and archive them. Preparing a data management plan should be your first step in the process to make data FAIR. The DMP template will ask questions that enable you to systematically address the things that need to be done to make your data FAIR. Writing aDMPis also a requirement from funding agencies and some faculties at VU Amsterdam. At VU Amsterdam, you can useDMPonlineto create and share DMPs.

#### Subtopic: Describe and document your data
To be findable, data need to be described with appropriate metadata. Metadata can include keywords, references to related papers, the researchers’ORCID identifiers, and the codes for the grants that supported the research. You will need to provide such metadata when you are uploading data to a repository (see below). You increase findability by filling out as many metadata fields as possible and by providing rich descriptions in terminology that is common in your field. To be reusable, data need to be accompanied by documentation describing how the data was created, structured, processed, and so on. It is good practice to integrate writing documentation during the research process. It will be easier and take less time compared to when you try to do this at the end. Having documentation on the research process will also help you to redo parts of your data cleaning actions or data analysis if necessary. If you have questions about metadata and documentation, contact theRDM Support Deskand we will be happy to help you and to provide advice.

#### Subtopic: Make your data available through a trustworthy repository
If you choose a repository that: assigns a persistent identifier to both the data and the metadata; attaches metadata to the data according to standard metadata schemas; releases data with a license; and provides access to the data and metadata via an open and standard communication protocol (such as http) – then your data will meet many, if not most, of the FAIR principles. VU Amsterdam provides three repositories which meets all of these conditions: DataverseNL Yoda Open Science Framework(OSF) Costs for using these repositories for datasets up to 500 GB are covered by the faculty. There are costs involved for you department or project if a datasets is larger than 500 GB. See thestorage cost modelfor details.

#### Subtopic: What if I cannot share my data?
Data do not need to be open to be FAIR. The FAIR principles allow for controlled access, which can be important for certain types of data, such as personal data, medical data, competitive company data. The guiding principle is always that data should be as “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. If data cannot be openly shared, because they are too sensitive, then “the FAIR approach would be to make the metadata publicly available and provide information about the conditions for accessing the data itself.”

### Topic: Finding Existing Data – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/finding-existing-data.html

#### Subtopic: Re-using Existing Data
Anything that can be used for analysis can be considered “data(sets)”. Many national and international organisations provide access to large datasets free of charge: this is calledOpen Data. Datasets may contain different kinds of data files, e.g. raw or edited/cleaned data, and macro or micro data.Raw datarefers to the data as they are primarily collected, and includes all data, even the missed or mismatched pieces in the data file.Edited or cleaned datarefers to data that have been tidied up for analysis and publication.Macro dataand statistics are results based onmicro dataunits and provide a general overview of the micro data. Although datasets can contain data of varying type or aggregation level, and there may be overlap between these definitions, each element can contain very important information. When re-using research data, scientists must be familiar with the rules and regulations governing data copyright, intellectual property rights, and laws governing sensitive or personal information. SURF has compiled areport on the legal status of raw dataincluding information on the types of consent required for the re-use of data. Your 🔒Privacy Championcan answer questions about the use of personal data.IXAcan provide legal help with the re-use of data. See also the ZonMw explanation ofdifferent kinds of property rights in the Netherlands(text available in Dutch only).

#### Subtopic: Sources for Finding Existing Datasets
The number of datasets that are available grows rapidly. Datasets are made available in many formats, by many people or organizations. Some datasets are raw files and some are specifically organised and formatted as databases that require a licence or subscription to use them. The library of VU Amsterdam has collected links to some of the data repositories used and has licensed several databases. Popular Free and Licensed Databases: These can be found withLibSearch Advanced. If you need help finding & using free or licensed sources you can contact theResearch Data Services Helpdesk. For students and personnel in the fields of economics, finance, or organisation science aseparate LibGuidehas been created to help them find and use/re-use data. You can also start looking for data in these four places: The literature. Research articles may point you to the data that they are based on. Sometimes, (part of) the data are added to the article as supplementary files, and sometimes the data are published separately in a data repository. In the latter case, the article usually provides a clear reference to the published dataset. Some datasets may even be specifically published inData Journals. Scientific data repositories. Data repositories are platforms used to access and archive research data. Universities often provide a repository for data archiving, but other platforms arranged by discipline or by country also exist. Some repositories are only accessible to consortium members, whereas others are free of charge. Many universities in the Netherlands useDataverseNLto archive datasets for the mid-term. Long-term archiving is provided by the national research data archivesDANSand4TU.Research Data. In Europe,B2SHAREandZenodoare platforms used to access research data. Data repositories can be accessed by searching by topic or country usingRe3data, a data repository registry. VU Amsterdam has its own research portal,PURE, where researchers register their datasets. You can find instructions on how to register your own dataset in PURE on theDataset Registrationpage of this LibGuide. Data search engines. Search engines allow you to quickly browse data sets and supplementary data files published by researchers. They cover data sets from many sources. This makes them useful for quick orientation on a topic. Example of a search engines are:DataCite,Google DataSet Search. Data portals of (governmental) organisations. Organisations that regularly collect (statistical) data sometimes offer these data through their own portal. An example isEurostat, which collects and disseminates statistics at the European level, by country and by theme. Some of these websites have been linked in theFinding data LibGuide.

#### Subtopic: Data Sources for VU Researchers
Researchers from VU Amsterdam have also developed some databases containing data collected during research. See here for some examples: Nederlands Tweelingenregister(Netherlands Twin Register) The database contains data on twins and their families and was created to do research on the relationship between genetics and growth, development, personality, behaviour, diseases, mental health and all kinds of risks. Geoplaza VU- the portal for all matters related to GIS (Geographical Information Systems) and geodata at VU Amsterdam. It offers students and employers a platform to exchange, examine and download digital map material. Dutch monasteries- database with information about Dutch monasteries of the Middle Ages. Slave owners in Amsterdam 1863- the place of living of owners of slaves in Amsterdam in 1863, visualized in GeoPlaza. Deaths at the Borders Database- collection of official, state-produced evidence on people who died while attempting to reach southern EU countries from the Balkans, the Middle East, and North & West Africa, and whose bodies were found in or brought to Europe. Datasets published by VU Researchers can be found at theVU Research Portal.

#### Subtopic: Re-using Existing Software
Depending on your particular field of research, there may beresearch softwareavailable that can help you develop your research. There is a lot of proprietary software which can be acquiredthrough the VU. Proprietary software generally has strict constraints regarding furthersharing and re-use of the software. Open-source softwareallows you to use and build upon existing software available in a variety of programming languages and domains. Research software can be found through both generic and discipline-specific registries or catalogues. When re-using research software, you must comply to constraints imposed by the licence of that software. Technically, this means some familiarity is needed with the rules and regulations governing software copyright and intellectual property rights. Practically, you will need to becompatiblewith the licence’s terms and conditions. The following scheme provides an overview of compatibility of commonly usedsoftware licences: A more complete list of open source licences with terms and conditions is availableon Choose A License. IXAcan provide legal help with the re-use of software.

#### Subtopic: Finding Existing Research Software
There is a large growth in the number of available open source research software. Many registries (also known as catalogues or “yellow pages”) are available to find existing research software. For example,PyPI(for python),CRAN(for R),Research Software Directory(generic). An extensive list of research software registries ismaintained by the eScience Center.

### Topic: General Data Protection Regulation – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/gdpr.html

#### Subtopic: Introduction
TheGeneral Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) is a European legislation that lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. TheDutch Implementation Act for the GDPR(UAVG) describes the implementation of the GDPR for the Netherlands.

#### Subtopic: Definitions
Personal datarefers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’). See also thedefinition of ’personal data’ according to the official text of the GDPR. Data processingrefers to any action performed on data, such as collecting, storing, modifying, distributing, deleting data. See also thedefinition of ‘processing’according the official text of the GDPR. Direct and indirect identification: Some identifiers enable you to identify an indiviual directly, such as name, day of birth and home address. Individuals can also be identifed indirectly. For example via:a combination of information that uniquely singles out an individual (e.g. a male with breast cancer in a breast cancer registry, a pregnant individual over 50 etc.), this includes information in one record and information across different data files or datasetsunique information or patterns that are specific to an individual (e.g. genomic data, a very specific occupation, such as the president of a large company, repeated physical measurements or movement patterns that create a unique profile of an individual or measurements that are extreme and could be linked to subjects such as high-level athletes)data that are linked to directly identifying information through a random identification code or number a combination of information that uniquely singles out an individual (e.g. a male with breast cancer in a breast cancer registry, a pregnant individual over 50 etc.), this includes information in one record and information across different data files or datasets unique information or patterns that are specific to an individual (e.g. genomic data, a very specific occupation, such as the president of a large company, repeated physical measurements or movement patterns that create a unique profile of an individual or measurements that are extreme and could be linked to subjects such as high-level athletes) data that are linked to directly identifying information through a random identification code or number Pseudonymous data: Data that are indirectly identifiable are generally considered to be pseudonymous; this means that they are NOT anonymous and still qualify as personal data. Therefore, the GDPR applies to these data. This is for example the case when direct identifiers are removed from the research data and put into a key file (or what is usually called a subject identification log in medical research) with which the direct identifiers can be mapped to the research data through unique codes, so that reidentification is possible. These data are therefore considered to be pseudonymous data for the research institution and not anonymised data. LCRDM (National Coordination Point Research Data Management) has made areference cardthat illustrates the difference between pseudonymous and anonymous data.

#### Subtopic: Privacy in research - Privacy five-step plan
Where research requires the collection of personal data, the researcher has to follow thePrivacy five-step planto make sure to carry out the research in line with the GDPR.

#### Subtopic: VSNU Code of Conduct for using personal data in research
The VSNU’s Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (Dutch,English, 2018) includes a reference to the GDPR and its Dutch implementation law UAVG. An updated Code of Conduct for Using Personal Data in Research which complies with GDPR is still work in progress.

#### Subtopic: Support in your faculty: Privacy Champions
Each faculty has one or more Privacy Champions, who are the first point of contact for questions relating to privacy and the GDPR. The Privacy Champions can help you with completing a Data Protection Impact Assessment, registering your research in the record of processing activities, designing informed consent forms and other questions relating to the GDPR. The 🔒list of Privacy Championscan be found on the VU website.

### Topic: Knowledge Security – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/knowledge-security.html

#### Subtopic: Introduction
Knowledge security is about secure international collaboration, which is very important for VU Amsterdam. For international collaboration to take place securely, it is necessary to assess the knowledge security risks associated with the research topic, the data that will be collected and/or the potential collaborative partner(s), which can be an institution or individual(s). This assessment has to take place before and during the start of a new research project. VU Amsterdam developed the Knowledge Security Framework (hereinafter: the Framework) as a useful and mandatory guide on asking the important and critical questions about the background of the foreign partner organisation or person, and the research project itself (topic, data, funding). The Framework and all necessary information regarding knowledge security can be found on theknowledge security page for employees.

#### Subtopic: The importance of knowledge security regarding research data
At VU Amsterdam, we attach great value to international collaboration, which is crucial for top-level research and high-quality academic education. As well as opportunities – for research, education, innovation and open knowledge sharing – it also entails risks. Universities are being targeted for acquiring sensitive knowledge and technologies. A possible consequence of this is the undermining of academic freedom and censorship (including self-censorship). The Framework addresses potential ethical issues, such as the risk of violating human rights or academic values, the misuse of knowledge, the safety of researchers and respondents (for instance if the research might cause them to be pressured or coerced), unintended knowledge transfer, and harm to people, animals or the environment. This means that it is important to consider the possible consequences for yourself, your colleagues and the research subjects if your research data falls into the wrong hands, e.g. data on a minority group or a key technology (especially technology that falls under dual use1regulation) that a repressive government can misuse. If you work with sensitive research data*, want to openly publish your data and/or your collaborative partner is an organisation or affiliated to an organisation from a country that has a score of 0.4 or less on theAcademic Freedom Index, the collaboration should be discussed with the faculty’s contact person. Also, measures can be taken in consultation with the contact person (seeSupport within your faculty) and data steward to mitigate the risks. Possible measures include limiting access to sensitive research data (physically and digitally, e.g. encryption), data anonymisation or pseudonymisation, an adequatedata classification, a Data Protection Impact Assessement (DPIA), limiting or excluding collaboration with certain partners and other appropriate protection measures. * Sensitive research data regarding knowledge security includes: Research data that falls under the dual use regulation1; Research data onkey technologies or other technologies that are considered by the Dutch government to be militarily, economically and geopolitically strategic; Research data on ethically sensitive topics (see question 5 of the Framework); Research data related to minority or repressed research subjects.

#### Subtopic: Support within your faculty
To provide support regarding knowledge security at VU Amsterdam, each faculty has one or more contact persons available who are the first point of contact for questions regarding knowledge security. The contact persons can be found on theknowledge security page for employees.

#### Subtopic: Footnotes
Dual use items are defined as ‘items, including software and technology, which can be used for both civil and military purposes, and includes items which can be used for the design, development, production or use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or their means of delivery, including all items which can be used for both non-explosive uses and assisting in any way in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices’ (definition taken from the European Union’sDual Use Regulation).↩︎ Dual use items are defined as ‘items, including software and technology, which can be used for both civil and military purposes, and includes items which can be used for the design, development, production or use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or their means of delivery, including all items which can be used for both non-explosive uses and assisting in any way in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices’ (definition taken from the European Union’sDual Use Regulation).↩︎

### Topic: Metadata – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/metadata.html

#### Subtopic: Metadata standards
Metadata standards allow for easier exchange of metadata and harvesting of the metadata by search engines. Many certified archives use a metadata standard for the descriptions. If you choose a data repository or registry, you should find out which metadata standard they use. At VU Amsterdam the following standards are used: Yoda uses theDataCite metadata standard DataverseNL uses theDublin Core metadata standard VU Amsterdam Research Information System PURE uses theCERIF metadata standard Many archives implement or make use of specific metadata standards. The UK Digital Curation Centre (DCC) provides anoverview of metadata standards for different disciplines. The list is a great and useful resource in establishing and carrying out your research methodology.

#### Subtopic: Controlled Vocabularies & Classifications
Controlled vocabularies are lists of terms created by domain experts to refer to a specific phenomenon or event. Controlled vocabularies are intended to reduce ambiguity that is inherent in normal human languages where the same concept can be given different names and to ensure consistency.Controlled vocabulariesare used in subject indexing schemes, subject headings, thesauri, taxonomies and other knowledge organisation systems. Some vocabularies are very internationally accepted and standardised and may even become anISO standardor a regional standard/classification. Controlled vocabularies can be broad in scope or very limited to a specific field. When a Data Management Plan template includes a question on the used ontology (if any), what is usually meant is: is there a specific vocabulary or classification system used? The National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Swedengives some more explanation about controlled vocabularies and ontologies. In short, an ontology does not only describe terms, but also indicates relationships between these terms. Examples of controlled vocabularies are: CDWA (Categories for the Description of Works of Art) Getty Thesaurus of Geographic names NUTS (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) Medical Subject HEadings (MeSH) The Environment Ontology (EnvO) Many examples of vocabularies and classification systems can be found at theFAIRsharing.org website. It has a large list for multiple disciplines. If you are working on new concepts or new ideas and are using or creating your own ontology/terminology, be sure to include them as part of the metadata documentation in your dataset (for example as part of yourcodebook).

#### Subtopic: Metadata levels
Finally a distinction can be made on the level of description. Metadata can be about the data as a whole or about part of the data. It can depend on the research domain and the tools that are used on how many levels the data can be described. In repositories like Yoda and DataverseNL it is common practice to only create structured metadata on the level of the data as a whole. The Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA) explains this distinction for several types of data in theirData Management Expert Guide.

#### Subtopic: Dataset registration
When you want to make sure that your dataset is findable it is recommended that the elements of the description of your dataset are made according to a certain metadata standard that allows for easier exchange of metadata and harvesting of the metadata by search engines. Many certified archives use a metadata standard for the descriptions. If you choose a data repository or registry, you should find out which metadata standard they use. At VU Amsterdam the following standards are used: DataverseNLandDANSuse theDublin Coremetadata standard VU Amsterdam Research PortalPUREuses theCERIFmetadata standard Many archives implement or make use of specific metadata standards. The UK Digital Curation Centre (DCC) provides an overview of metadata standards for different disciplines. The list is a great and useful resource in establishing and carrying out your research methodology. Go to theoverview of metadata standards.

Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/osf.html

#### Subtopic: What is it?
TheOpen Science Framework(OSF) is a cloud-based open-source research project management tool that supports researchers throughout the active research stage. It facilitates collaboration, connects services across the research life cycle, materials, and other research objects for private use or public sharing. The OSF is developed by theCenter of Open Science (COS)that strives to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research. This is in line with theVU open science commitmentwhere the aim is to make the process of creating and sharing scientific knowledge more transparent, inclusive and equitable. As acollaboration tool, OSF helps research teams work on projects privately or make them publicly accessible for broad dissemination. As aworkflow system, OSF enables connections to the many products researchers already use, streamlining their process and increasing efficiency. Researchers can manage files, data, code, and protocols in one centralised location and easily build custom organisation for their unique needs. Integrated metadata support on project level improves findability and reuse of research materials. Soon content on OSF will support FAIR metadata for all files, which will even further enhance responsible preservation and discovery. Read more about OSF best practices for new OSF users inOSF Getting startedbelow.

### Topic: Persistent Identifier – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/persistent-identifier.html

#### Subtopic: Multiple PID systems
There are multiple PID systems, each with its own particular properties. Examples of widely used PIDs in the research domain include the following. DOI: ADigital Object Identifiercan be used to refer to research data, research software and publications. ORCiD: AnOpen Researcher and Contributor IDis used to create a researcher profile with a unique identification number. ROR: TheResearch Organization Registryis a global register with persistent identifiers for research institutes. See thePersistent Identifier guideof Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed for a more elaborate overview. Apart from widely used domain-agnostic PIDs, there is a wide range of domain-specific unique identifiers that can be used. If you are interested in domain-specific identifiers, it is useful to ask colleagues in your department or discipline.

#### Subtopic: Persistent Identifiers for data and software in repositories
Persistent Identifiers can be assigned to datasets and software upon their deposit in a repository. In many repositories, this is a DOI. Data repositories are entitled to generate Persistent Identifiers for data and software. This is one of the reasons whyarchivingandpublishingdata and software has to be done in a repository. After the process of uploading data or software to a repository, a Persistent Identifier will be generated. Upon publishing the data or software, the DOI is registered online (usually atDataCitewhen it concerns a dataset). Some repositories enable their users to reserve a Persistent Identifier before the publishing process has finished, so that you can include the Persistent Identifier in a publication before the data will be actually published, or to include the Persistent Identifier in a readme file. This is for example possible inZenodo. The repositories offered by VU Amsterdam,YodaandDataverseNLprovide DOIs for deposited datasets and software.

#### Subtopic: Creating and using an ORCiD
Researchers can use anORCiDto identify their research output as their work. You can request an ORCiD yourself. Instructions for setting up an ORCiD and connecting it to your VU research profile in PURE are available in thisORCiD LibGuide. An ORCiD is often asked for when you submit a publication or upload data or software to a repository. You can use your ORCiD record to create a research profile as well.

#### Subtopic: Using a ROR
Researchers can use theRORforVU Amsterdamwhen filling metadata forms for their research output to show that their work has been created within their employment at VU Amsterdam.

#### Subtopic: FAIR Principles
Principles for making research data Findable (F), Accessible (A), Interoperable (I) and Reusable (R).

#### Subtopic: Metadata
Data that describe characteristics of other data. In the research context this concerns data that provide further information and context about research data. Metadata describe the data and the context in which they have been collected or created. See alsoResearch data.

#### Subtopic: Persistent identifier
In short, and in the current context, a Persistent Identifier (PID) is essentially a URL that will never break. There are multiple PID systems, each with its own particular properties. Examples of widely used PIDs in the research domain include: A Digital Object Identifier can be used to refer to research data and research software. DOIs can be assigned to datasets and software upon their deposit in a repository. An Open Researcher and Contributor ID is used to create a researcher profile with a unique identification number. Researchers can request an ORCiD themselves, with which they can identify their research output as their work. The Research Organization Registry is a global register with persistent identifiers for research institutes. Researchers can use the ROR for VU Amsterdam when filling metadata forms for their research output to show that their work has been created within their employment at VU Amsterdam. See thePersistent Identifier guide of Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoedfor a more elaborate overview. Apart from widely used domain-agnostic PIDs, there is a wide range of domain-specific unique identifiers that can be used.

#### Subtopic: Research data
Information that is captured for the purpose of underpinning academic research. Depending on the discipline it may consist of, for example, text, images, sound, spreadsheets, databases, statistical data, geographic data, etc. When we refer to research data in this policy, we refer to the entirety of the data itself, this includes any associated metadata and documentation.

#### Subtopic: Research data management
“Research data management is an explicit process covering the creation and stewardship of research materials to enable their use for as long as they retain value.”1

#### Subtopic: Research life cycle
The research life cycle outlines the various stages and activities of a research project, from preparation to disseminating the results.

#### Subtopic: Research software

Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/research-data-management.html

#### Subtopic: Research Data Management (RDM) – Research Support Handbook
Research Data Management (RDM) – Research Support Handbook RDM concerns the organisation, documentation, storage, archiving and sharing of digital and analogue data. Data management applies throughout the entire research data life cycle, which is visualised in the circle above. RDM aims to ensure reliable verification of results, and permits new and innovative research built on existing information. RDM is also part of the research process and is intended to make the research process as efficient as possible. The Research Support Handbook provides guidance on research data management planning, data storage and protection, data archiving, and other resources. The Data Management Plan provides information on how these activities will be carried out during the research project. Good data management will heighten the quality of your own research (data) as well as your institution’s scientific output, and it contributes significantly to your field as a whole.

### Topic: Research Software – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/research-software.html

#### Subtopic: What is Research Software?
There is a broad definition of research software from theFAIR4RS working group: “Research Software includes source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows and executables that were created during the research process or for a research purpose. Software components (e.g., operating systems, libraries, dependencies, packages, scripts, etc) that are used for research but were not created during or with a clear research intent should be considered software in research and not Research Software.” It is important to note that not all software that is used in research is research software. For example, a text editor that is used to write a paper is not research software. Nor is powerpoint, a web browser, or the software used to guide the telescope. Even tools like R or Python are not necessarily research software. The code written in R or Python for an analysis would be research software, however. Just like a custom-made Excel macro that is used to analyse data. Or a custom-made web application that is used to collect data. Research Software is mainly used in “Collecting” and “Processing & analyzing” steps. However, non-research software can also be used in these steps, and research software can also be used in other steps. Materials adapted fromthe Netherlands eScience CenterunderCC-BY 4.0.

### Topic: Research Drive – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/researchdrive.html

#### Subtopic: What is it?
SURF Research Driveis an online storage and collaboration platform for research data. With Research Drive you can easily store and share files with other researchers, inside and outside VU Amsterdam. You can access your data via a web interface or tools, from anywhere in the world. Research Drive is based on the Open SourceownCloudsoftware and is hosted by SURF in their Amsterdam datacentre.

#### Subtopic: Data storage
Research Drive is a Cloud storage solution that can be used for small (a few GBs) to larger (a few TBs) datasets. Because it is a cloud storage platform you will need to download data to your laptop to work with it. Research Drive makes this easy by using the ownCloud client, which allows you to automatically sync the folders you want to work with. Data is backed up daily.

#### Subtopic: Data sharing
As project owner you can invite internal and external collaborators yourself, or you can delegate this task to others. You can set access rights to folders and subfolders yourself, making Research Drive ideal for use in collaborations with many institutions.

#### Subtopic: Sensitive data
Hosting at SURF and the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), among other measures, makes Research Drive suitable for storing data that score Medium on confidentiality (see thePolicy Classification of Research Dataand theResearch Data Classification Tool). Data that score High on confidentiality can be stored in Research Drive with additional security measures. Please make sure to contact theRDM Support Deskto check if further measures are needed.

#### Subtopic: Data life cycle
Research Drive is meant for data you are actively working with. We recommend to archive datasets that are no longer actively used, but can’t be deleted, in a repository. Transferring data from Research Drive to a repository ensures Research Drive is used optimally and costs are kept down for your research group and VU Amsterdam. Repositories that are available at VU Amsterdam areYodaandDataverseNL.Yodais suitable for all types of data, including personal data and other types of confidential data.DataverseNLis only suitable for data that can be made available publicly.

#### Subtopic: Collaborative tools
Within Research Drive, various apps and integrations are available to simplify the use and handling of research data, such as a tool to edit documents directly in the web interface. You can find a current list of app integrations on theSURF User Knowledge Base.

#### Subtopic: SURFdrive replacement
Since both are based on ownCloud, Research Drive is very similar to SURFdrive, the main difference is that SURFdrive is personal storage while Research Drive is group based. Researchers looking for a new home for research data currently on SURFdrive are encouraged to migrate to Research Drive. Manuals for migrating data to Research Drive are available inEnglishandDutch. Please contact theResearch Support Deskif you have any questions about migrating to Research Drive.

#### Subtopic: How to request access
A new Research Drive projectfolder can be requested via the form on 🔒ServiceNow, go to: Research Data Support > Research Data Support > Request Research Drive. Once the projectfolder is created you can invite internal and external collaborators yourself.

#### Subtopic: Are there costs involved?
The costs of storing data in Research Drive are detailed on the 🔒VU website.

#### Subtopic: Getting started
Log in to the Research Drive web application atvu.data.surfsara.nl. You are only able to log in after you have been invited to one or more project folders. The login process requires a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) account, which students do not have by default.

### Topic: Safe Data Transportation and Transfer – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/safe-data-transfer.html

#### Subtopic: Transferring digital data
If data collection takes place through a certain measurement device (e.g. MRI scanner, EEG scanner, eye tracker), the data need to be transferred from the measurement device to the storage location that you will use during your research project. Make sure that this transfer takes place in a secure way and also make a plan for the data on the measurement device; find out whether they need to be destroyed or can remain there. If you are doing fieldwork outside the campus and you have reliable and secure internet access, it is a good idea to upload the data to a storage location that is regularly backed up and secure, in order to prevent data loss. If you have a VUnetID, you can for example use: Research Driveto securely and easily store and share research data. SURFfilesenderto send you data to a colleague or consortium partner, who can store your data in an appropriate place You can find more information about each of these storage options in theData Storagetopic. If you need to receive data from colleagues in your project who don’t have access to these tools (e.g. because they are students, don’t work for a Dutch educational institution, or have no VUnetID), Research Drive, Yoda, SURFfilesender and secure emailing with Zivver can also be used: Research Drive: This cloud storage service provided by SURF enables researchers from VU and external researchers to manage files and folders in a shared storage location. SURFfilesender: as a SURFfilesender user, you can send a voucher to someone who doesn’t have access to this tool. This person can use this voucher to send documents to you. These files can be encrypted. Yoda: This cloud storage service provided by SURF enables researchers from VU and external researchers to manage files and folders in a shared storage location. 🔒Zivver is an email plugin with which you can encrypt emails and attachments. If you are doing fieldwork in an area with limited internet access, you might use a portable device to initially store your data during the phase of data collection, such as a USB drive or an external hard drive. These data can be transferred to a storage location that is connected to the internet (e.g. Research Drive, Yoda) later. Please make sure that the data on such portable devices are secured, by using encryption (and by transporting them safely by using a lockable briefcase or backpack).

#### Subtopic: Transporting physical data
If physical objects need to be transported, you should check with the data manager at your department (if available) what options are available. Special briefcases that can be locked or secure backpacks may need to be used to keep informed consent forms or other sensitive data objects (USB drives etc.) secure during transport. A checklist may help to ensure all objects will be taken along.

#### Subtopic: Data transportation and transfer across borders
Some countries have rules to control the movement of encryption technology that enter or exit their borders. If you need to travel with an encrypted laptop to secure your data, for example during fieldwork abroad, please keep this in mind. If you need to transfer data in and out of such countries, please get advice on encryption and secure transportation at theIT Service Desk.

#### Subtopic: Support
If you have general questions about how to protect your data when transporting or transferring them, you can contact theIT Service Desk. In case of complex situations for which you need tailored support, you can consult the IT Relationship Manager representing the research domain, who can request capacity at IT for setting up an information security plan. Such a plan is usually based on documents which need to be completed beforehand, like aData Protection Impact Assessmentand aData Classification.

### Topic: SciStor – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/scistor.html

#### Subtopic: What is it?
The storage service SciStor is intended for cheaply storing large amounts of research data. SciStor is hosted by IT for Research (ITvO) on the VU campus enabling a high-speed connection to lab equipment, laptops and workstations, theADA HPC clusterandSciCloud. It can also be accessed off-campus. Your data is stored in ashare, basically a folder with group-based access rights (read/write or read-only). Access rights can be set one level deep, so one share could be used to host data from different projects. If desired, automaticbackupscan be made of the data.

#### Subtopic: Networked Drive
Because SciStor is connected to the VU on-campus network you can directly mount (map a network drive) SciStor shares on your laptop and work as if the data is on a local disk.

#### Subtopic: Access off-campus
Although SciStor is most useful on campus you can alsoaccess your shares off-campus.

#### Subtopic: Lab instruments
In many cases lab equipment can write data directly to SciStor.IT for Researchcan help you setup an automated and secure connection.

#### Subtopic: Storage space for SciCloud servers
SciCloudvirtual servers are provisioned with a 20 to 50GB local disk. A SciStor share can be directly mounted on the server to increase storage for your application or directly access your source data for analysis.

#### Subtopic: ADA
TheADA HPC clusteris connected to SciStor via a high speed netwodrk. You can run your analysis software directly on your data and easily access the results on your laptop.

#### Subtopic: Sharing data
Because SciStor is mainly intended for high performance, on-campus use, access is only possible with a VUnetId. If you need to share data with non-VU researchers you couldregister them as an external employeeor host a copy of the data on another storage platform like Research Drive orYoda

#### Subtopic: Data life-cycle
SciStor is meant for data you are actively working with. We recommend archiving datasets that are no langer actively used, but can’t be deleted, inYoda. This ensures SciStor is used optimally and costs are kept down for your research group and the VU.

#### Subtopic: Requesting a new share
SciStor is available for all VU research groups. You can find the request form on 🔒ServiceNow, go to: IT > My work field > Research > SciStor > Realisation of new storage for research (SciStor) Minimum storage space that can be requested is 100 GB, for a minimum of three months. The capacity can be increased or decreased in units of 100 GB if needed. After submitting the application, IT for Research will contact you to schedule an interview to discuss naming the SciStor share, how the backups work, who should have access, etc. Most SciStor configurations can be delivered within one or two days. More complex configurations may take a little longer.

#### Subtopic: Adding a colleague to an existing share
The owner of a SciStor share can request to add or remove access to the share via 🔒ServiceNow, go to: IT > My work field > Research > SciStor > Change SciStor access rights

#### Subtopic: Are there costs involved?
You pay for the amount of space reserved for your share: €0,10 per GB per year without backup or €0,20 per GB per year with backup. Note that without backup data will be lost in case of accidental deletion or major problems with the SciStor infrastructure. The owner of the SciStor share receives monthly usage reports. The report provides insight on used and available space.

#### Subtopic: Backups
There are two type of flavours when it comes to data protection within SciStor. The ITvO team recommend having both ways activated for complete data protection.

#### Subtopic: On-campus access
Open the Finder application In the “Go” menu, pick “Connect to Server…” or press “⌘K” Fill in:smb://scistor.vu.nl/shares Click “Connect” Select “Registered User” if this is not yet selected Fill in your VUnetID and password Press “Connect”. Optionally, tick the “Remember this password in my keychain” checkbox. After doing this, macOS will no longer ask for credentials the next time this connection is used. SciStor shares appear on the left after opening the SciStor location. You may open the desired SciStor share by double-clicking it. Open Windows File Explorer Right-click on This PC and choose “Map network drive…”” Select a desired drive letter, for example S.

### Topic: Storing vs. Archiving Data – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/selecting-data.html

#### Subtopic: Selecting Data for Archiving
There are various reasons toarchive your data: replication, longitudinal research, data being unique or expensive to collect, re-usability and acceleration of research inside or outside your own discipline. It is VU policy to archive your data for (at least) 10 years after the last publication based on the dataset. Part of preparing your dataset for archiving is appraising and selecting your data.

#### Subtopic: Make a selection before archiving your data
During your research you may accumulate a lot of data, some of which will be eligible for archiving. It is impossible to preserve all data infinitely. Archiving all digital data leads to high costs for storage itself and for maintaining and managing this ever-growing volume of data and their metadata; it may also lead to decline in discoverability (see the website of theDigital Curation Centre). For those reasons, it is crucial that you make a selection.

#### Subtopic: Remove redundant and sensitive data
Selecting data means making choices about what to keep for the long term, and what data toarchive securely and what data to publish openly. This means that you have to decide whether your dataset contains data that need to be removed or separated. Reasons to exclude data from publishing include (but are not limited to): data are redundant data concern temporary byproducts which are irrelevant for future use data contain material that is sensitive, for example personal data in the sense of theGDPR, like consent forms, voice recordings, DNA data; state secrets; data that are sensitive to competition in a commercial sense. These data need to be separated from other data and archived securely preserving data for the long term is in breach of contractual arrangements with your consortium partners or other parties involved In preparing your dataset for archiving, the first step is to determine which parts of your data are sensitive, which can then be separated from the other data. Redundant data can be removed altogether.

#### Subtopic: Different forms of datasets for different purposes
Once you have separated the sensitive data from the rest of your dataset, you have to think about what to do with these sensitive materials. In some cases they may be destroyed, but you may also opt for archiving multiple datasets. For example, you may want to archive your dataset in more than one form depending on the purpose. For example: One for reusability to share A second one that contains the sensitive data, and needs to be handled differently. For the first, the non-sensitive data can be stored in an archive under restricted or open access conditions, so that you can share it and link it to publications. For the second, you need to make a separate selection, so the sensitive part can be stored safely in a secure archive (a so-called offline or dark archive). In the metadata of both archives you can create stable links between the two datasets usingpersistent identifiers.

#### Subtopic: What to appraise for archiving
There are several factors that determine what data to select for archiving. For example, whether data are unique, expensive to reproduce, or if your funder requires that you make your data publicly available. This might also help you or your department to think about a standard policy or procedures for what needs to be kept, what is vital for reproducing research or reuse in future research projects. More information on selecting data: Tjalsma, H. & Rombouts, J. (2011).Selection of research data: Guidelines for appraising and selecting research data. Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS). Digital Curation Centre (DCC): Whyte, A. & Wilson, A. (2010).How to appraise and select research data for curation. DCC How-to Guides. Edinburgh: Digital Curation Centre. Research Data Netherlands:Data selection.

#### Subtopic: Data Set Packaging: Which Files should be Part of my Dataset?
A dataset consists of the following documents: Raw or cleaned data (if the cleaned data has been archived, theprovenancedocumentation is also required) Project documentation Codebookorprotocol Logbook or lab journal(when available, dependent on the discipline) Software(& version) needed to open the files when no preferred formats for the data can be provided See the topicMetadatafor more information about documenting your data. Depending on the research project it may be that more than one dataset is stored in more than one repository. Make sure that each consortium partner that collects data also stores all necessary data that is required for transparency and verification. AConsortium AgreementandData Management Planwill include information on who is responsible for archiving the data.

### Topic: Snellius – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/snellius.html

#### Subtopic: What is it?
Snellius is the National Supercomputer infrastructure hosted by SURF in Amsterdam.

#### Subtopic: Simulation and modelling
Do you work with large and complex models that require a lot of computing power? The National Supercomputer provides that with a large number of super-fast processors. The system is ideally suited for large-scale experiments, such as simulations and modelling. These require a lot of processing power and memory usage, but also communication between the different processors. An important feature of Snellius is its fast internal network.

#### Subtopic: Computing power
Snellius runs on Linux. Besides AMD processors, the system also features GPGPUs (General Purpose Graphics Processing Units). These accelerators combine the processing power of graphics cards (GPUs) with that of CPUs. In addition, Snellius has ‘fat nodes’ with more memory space (1 TB) and ‘high-memory nodes’ (4 TB and 8 TB of memory space).

#### Subtopic: Tools and libraries
As a researcher, you can make use of a large collection of tools, compilers and libraries. Are you doing research or experiments in the field of machine learning, e.g. neural networks? The libraries and tools on Snellius make it a lot easier.

#### Subtopic: How to request access
You can request access via a form on the 🔒SURF service desk portal. There are 2 options:

#### Subtopic: 1. Direct institute contract
The VU has a contract with SURF for the usage of Snellius. Every VU researcher or master student can request Snellius SBUs (System Billing Units). The total amount available to the VU is limited however, only use this option for smaller projects, say up to 1.000.000 CPU and/or GPU SBUs. TheSURF wikiprovides some guidance on estimating the amount of SBUs you need. We recommend you start with the default 50.000 CPU and/or GPU SBUs. You can use the same form to request a top-up if you run out.

#### Subtopic: 2. NWO compute grant
If you have a large project involving more than 1.000.000 CPU and/or GPU SBUs you should apply for anNWO Large Compute applications grant. Each Snellius account is provided with 200GB Home space (backups available), apart from that 8TB of temporary fastscratchspace is available for your calculations. If the Home space is not sufficient or you can requestProject Spaceto store your data during your project. Note that theProject Spaceis not backed-up! Always make sure a copy of valuable data is also stored on arecommended storage system. Note that for large-scale GPU projects access the EuropeanLUMIsupercomputer can also be requested by VU researcers.Obtaining compute time on LUMI.

#### Subtopic: Are there costs involved?
There are no direct costs for researchers, but be aware that “Direct institute contract” usage costs are billed to the faculties via KDM (“Kosten Doorbelasting Model”).

#### Subtopic: Getting started
TheSURF User Knowledge Basehas lots of information to get you started. SURF organises regular “Introduction to Supercomputing” training sessions, these are free to attend for VU researchers. Please consult theSURF Agendafor dates and registration. Note that there is a free community partition available on theVU HPC cluser ADA, where you can refine your analysis scripts before running them on the more expensive Snellius cluster. Experts atIT for Researchcan help you optimise your code to run more efficiently.

#### Subtopic: Contact
SURF offers limited direct support for researchers using Snellius. To ask a question create a ticket on the 🔒SURF Service Desk Portal. For general questions on HPC please contactIT for Research.

### Topic: Software Archiving – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/software-archiving.html

#### Subtopic: What is Software Archiving?
When we mentiondata archivingat VU Amsterdam, we mean the following: Creation of a secure and immutable copy of research data, associated metadata, accompanying documentation, and software code (where relevant) with the intention to ensure (conditional) access for a predetermined, minimum, period of time. In the case ofsoftware archivingthe software code takes the place of research data in the above quote. The two main differences are the inclusion of a version number in the metadata and the distinction ofuseranddeveloperdocumentation. As stated in theResearch Data and Software Management Policy, researchers are responsible for archiving all research software and data that leads to a published result (either in an article or other narrative form) in a trusted repository for a period of at least ten years after this publication, unless legal requirements, discipline-specific guidelines or contractual arrangements dictate otherwise.

#### Subtopic: Purpose
Software archiving is a vital approach to allow research to be verified and reproduced. Verification is important for a transparent research practice, a value VU Amsterdam is strongly committed to. Software is typically used to clean and analyse datasets gathered or recorded by researchers, meaning it is a fundamental part of the research process. Archiving your software ensures that software will be preserved for the long term and can be accessed, even when the Principal Investigator or other members of the research team are no longer available at VU Amsterdam. Proper software archiving transforms research software from temporary project tools into lasting scientific contributions that continue to generate value long after the original project concludes, supporting both individual career development and broader scientific progress.

#### Subtopic: Requirements
At VU Amsterdam, we strive to make our research softwareFAIR. When research software is archived in a repository provided by VU Amsterdam (YodaorDataverseNL), the following requirements apply: The software must be provided with associated Metadata using theVU Minimal metadata guide; The software must have aPersistent identifier(or Identifiers) to increase findability; A licence must be applied to the data and software in order to indicate if it can be reused by others and if so, under which conditions. Without a license the software cannot be used in future research as easily; The software must be accompanied by documentation, both user and developer. User documentation should cover installation and basic use, whereas developer documentation should cover how it works and why certain design decisions were made. If you use an external repository, these requirements are useful to keep in mind as well, because they make the software FAIR to a large extent, but in that case you will have to rely on the properties of the repository. Since code can be written in any number of ways to solve a problem, the absolute minimum that should be archived to ensure verification is a (working) copy of the code (or workflow) that takes the raw data to the end result and a list of the dependencies and their versions.

#### Subtopic: How does software archiving work in practice?
Data archiving must happen in a repository. This means that data storage solutions for during research, like Research Drive, are not suitable for software archiving. They don’t generate a Persistent Identifier and do not ask for metadata or a licence. Code repositories like GitHub and GitLab fall under the label of development environments: They have the possibility to include a DOI and metadata, but do not require it. As a result, VU Amsterdam recommends using the following services for archiving research software: Zenodo: Long-term preservation with permanent DOIs, integrated with GitHub for automatic archiving DataverseNL: For software associated with published datasets and research outputs Yoda: For data and software associated with research; note that this is not by default publicly accessible. A more complete form of software archiving involves capturing not just the source code, but also the complete software environment, dependencies, documentation, and metadata necessary to understand, execute, and maintain the software over time. This includes preserving information about the runtime environment, operating system requirements, library dependencies, and usage instructions. As a result, unlike regular backup or version control, software archiving specifically focuses on long-term preservation to combat software decay and technological obsolescence.

#### Subtopic: How does this help you in your research?
Archiving is a form of preservation and preserving your work means it remains accessible and usable for the rest of the research community for longer. This will allow greater levels of research continuity and help to avoid duplication of code reducing research time and costs in your field. Correctly archiving will include a DOI, licence, documentation, and metadata allowing you to receive more citations and professional recognition, avoid legal disputes on sharing your work, open you up to global collaboration, meet requirements needed for additional funding and publications, and makes knowledge transfer easier. A detailed workflow for archiving is available in the guide aboutarchiving and publishing data.

### Topic: Software Licensing – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/software-licensing.html

#### Subtopic: Licensing software
Publishing research software under an appropriate licence is crucial for its accessibility, usability, and further integration into research. Choosing a licence usually happens right when you start developing the software or when you put it in a public repository, rather than when the software is finished and fully baked. A software licence states how other people may re-use your code and under which circumstances. For research software, it is recommended (and often required by funders) that licences are as permissible as possible. There are many licences out there; below we list some very frequently used licences in research software. However, if none of these licences fit your case, there are several tools that can help you tochoosea suitable software licence. If you need guidance in choosing a licence for your software, get in touch with theRDM Support Desk.

#### Subtopic: MIT License
TheMIT Licenseis a popular choice, due to its readability and permissiveness. It allows users to reuse the software for any purpose, including using, copying, modifying, and distributing it, provided they include the original copyright notice and licence text. However, its permissiveness means that derivative works can be closed-source and do not need to mention that they use your code, which might not align with all scientific openness goals or general.

#### Subtopic: GNU GPLv3
TheGNU General Public License (GPLv3)is another option, designed to ensure that the software and any derivatives remain open-source. This encourages collaborative improvement of software. Any software that includes GPL-licensed code must also be open-source under the GPLpotentially deterring commercial use or integration with proprietary software. In conclusion, when you want your code to be used by others, but only the code that uses your code is also open source, this is the way to go.

#### Subtopic: Apache License 2.0
TheApache License 2.0allows for modification and distribution of the software and its derivative works, with the requirement that changes to the original code are documented. It is a more complex licence than the MIT License and can be incompatible with GPL-licensed software. The specifics of this go beyond the scope of the handbook.

#### Subtopic: Adding a licence to GitHub
On GitHub you add a licence on creating a new repository, by selecting the licence from the drop-down menu. If your repository already exists, add a new file called “LICENSE” using the “+”-button on top of the repository (see below). One the next page, start to type LICENSE as the file name, and a button to “Choose a license template” should automatically pop up. Follow the steps provided by GitHub to finish adding the licence to the repository. You should now see your licence shown on the main page of your repository.

#### Subtopic: Further considerations
If you are reusing software or libraries written by someone else, you must stick to the clauses of the licence given to the original software/library; When choosing a licence, do not just think about whatothersmay do with the software, but also whatyoumight want to do with the software in the future.

### Topic: Software Publishing – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/software-publishing.html

#### Subtopic: What is software publishing?
When we mentionsoftware publishingat VU Amsterdam, we mean the following: Making research data, associated metadata, accompanying documentation, and software code (where relevant) accessible in a repository in such a manner thatthey can be discovered on the Webandreferred to in a unique and persistent way(Inspired by the definition in theCODATA Research Data Management Terminology). As stated in theResearch Data and Software Management Policy, researchers are responsible for publishing all research software that leads to a published result (either in an article or other narrative form) for scientific reuse, meaning that these materials can be discovered on the Web and referred to in a unique and persistent way. This means that the existence of software is announced and that basic information about this software (like title, creator, moment of publication, version, etc.) can be found online, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that others will be able to access and download the actual software. If software contains (or will reveal) confidential information, information to which intellectual properties apply, and/or personal data, an assessment must take place to determine whether the software can be made available for reuse and if so, under which conditions. A custom licence (‘restricted’ or ‘closed’) will indicate if conditional access can be granted, and if so, what the conditions are.

#### Subtopic: Purpose
Publishing software is crucial for the accessibility of research output. It helps to make VU Amsterdam’s research visible, verifiable and, where possible, reusable. These are important goals for VU Amsterdam, as they contribute to a transparent reseach practice and enable other researchers to build on work that has been done by VU researchers. Publishing software means that researchers make their software known to the world, even if they cannot be accessed by others directly, but only after granting conditional access. This enables other researchers to reuse the software, leading to more impact of research that is carried out at VU Amsterdam. It may also result in new collaborations and citations. Another advantage is that it makes the work of a researcher more visible, going beyond the visibility of a publication alone. Publication of research is not complete without the data used and the code written to clean and analyse it. Publishing data and software allows other researchers to use and build upon your work.

#### Subtopic: Requirements
At VU Amsterdam, we strive to make our research softwareFAIR. Publishing software is a crucial step in making it findable. As explained in the definition above, publishing means that you make software discoverable on the internet. As a result, other researchers can find out about the existence of your code and consider whether it may be useful for them in their own research. Apersistent identifierhelps in making software findable, because it ensures that the persistent identifier always resolves to the correct digital object. Richmetadataalso contribute to the findability of software. The more information you provide, the more likely it is that others will be able to find your software. It is beneficial to use terminology that is common in your discipline when filling out the metadata fields in a repository as well as key words in a key words or notes section of the metadata. Rich information about your software will also help other researchers determine whether your software is potentially relevant for them and is faster to assess than reading through the code itself. Repositories provided by VU Amsterdam (YodaandDataverseNL) will generate aPersistent Identifierfor your software and they will ask you to fill outmetadatafields. In this way, they contribute to making your software findable. This will also be the case for external trusted repositories (such asZenodo). When you publish your software, it is important to apply alicenceto it. If you don’t do that, others will not be allowed to reuse your software. A licence is a legal instrument that tells others what they can and cannot do with your software and is therefore an important aspect of making software reusable. Since code can be written in any number of ways to solve a problem, the absolute minimum that should be published to ensure verification is a (working) copy of the code/workflow that uses the raw data to produce the end result you have presented in your research and a list of the dependencies and their versions.

#### Subtopic: How does software publishing work in practice?
As mentioned above, software publishing must happen through a repository. These can be provided by VU Amsterdam or third parties. VU Amsterdam:YodaDataverseNL Yoda DataverseNL External:Zenodo Zenodo Often, code can also be published through software developing platforms. VU Amsterdam:GitLab GitLab External:CodebergGithub Codeberg Github Some of these provide an integrated option to get a DOI for your software or have documentation on how to include one within their recommended workflow. Note thatOSFcan be used to publish code as well, but that you cannot assign a DOI to your software files specifically. You can assign a DOI at project level, but currently it is not possible in OSF to create an immutable copy of a file with its own DOI. For that reason, OSF is not the most suitable option for publishing software. If you do prefer to make your research output visible through OSF, you can consider having an additional copy of your code in theYoda vaultorconnecting published software in DataverseNL to your OSF project, so that it can be viewed in OSF. Detailed workflows addressing publishing software can be found in the guide aboutmaking your software FAIRand the topic aboutarchiving software.

#### Subtopic: How does this help you in your research?
Formally published software is not always expected from research, but it can have many benefits. Publishing your software will not only allow for more citations, but it will also help you to reach broader audiences and provide more opportunities for collaboration both outside your field and institution. Although not always needed, publishing your software can help with grant applications and foster a community norm of sharing code in your field speeding up research by avoiding duplication.

### Topic: Yoda – Research Support Handbook
Source: https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/yoda.html

#### Subtopic: What is it?
Yoda is an application for institutions that supports Research Data Management (RDM) throughout the entire research cycle: from the safe and easy storage and sharing of data during the research process, to the sharing of data within research collaborations and ultimately to research data archiving and publication. Yoda helps the researcher make their data “FAIR” by providing a solution that enables data discovery and sharing (i.e., findable, accessible). In addition, it facilitates the use of metadata, contributing to data interoperability and reusability. Yoda provides a platform for the implementation of standard workflows that can ensure metadata quality satisfyingVU policy requirementsfor data archiving and publication. In addition, Yoda is built oniRODSso it accommodates both researchers with data heavy requirements, as well as those seeking an accessible, user-friendly solution. Yoda presents researchers a comfortable, easy-to-use solution for securely storing, sharing and organising their research data that follows the internationally adoptedFAIRdata principles. Many research institutions and funding organisations (such as NWO and ZonMw) require researchers to make their data FAIR. Project space in Yoda is basically a folder with group based access rights. Access restrictions are only set on the top level, meaning you need one Project Space per research project. Yoda is open source softwaredeveloped and maintained by Utrecht University for the Yoda Consortium (VU, Wageningen University, Erasmus University, Amsterdam UMC, Utrecht University and SURF). Yoda is hosted by SURF in their Amsterdam datacentre.

#### Subtopic: What can it be used for?
The particular strength of Yoda lies in the fact that it is an all-in-one solution for managing your data during and after your project. It makes it easy to share and organise your data and add descriptive metadata at any moment. If (part of) your datasets needs to be published during or after your project, this can be done by a few simple steps within Yoda itself. There is no need to upload your data to another platform.

#### Subtopic: Data storage
Yoda is a Cloud storage solution that can be used for small to very large datasets. The underlyingiRODSsoftware ensures data integrity. Data in Yoda is backed up daily.

#### Subtopic: Data sharing
Once a new Yoda group has been created you can invite collaborators yourself. Researchers from national and international research institutes can login with their institutional account viaSURF Research Access Management (SRAM). Collaborators from non-research institutes can create a free EduID NL account.

#### Subtopic: Sensitive data
The use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with SRAM and hosting at SURF ensure, among other things, Yoda is suitable for the storage and sharing of data that score High on confidentiality in a data classification (see thePolicy Classification of Research Dataand theResearch Data Classification Tool). Please make sure to contact theRDM Support Deskto check if further measures are needed.

#### Subtopic: Metadata
At any moment you can add descriptive metadata to a folder in Yoda via a web form. This means you can easily organize your data in such a way that it is not only ready for archiving and publishing but also findable for your collaborators.

#### Subtopic: Archiving
At any moment you can submit a data folder with metadata for Archiving in the YodaVault. Data in the Vault is read-only and cannot be deleted. To help make sure the dataset is suitable for archiving a Yodadatamanager(usually a data manager from your department or a faculty data steward) will review your submission before final approval. Data in the Vault is directly accessible for your collaborators. Access for the Yoda datamanager role ensures the data remains accessible on the long term.

#### Subtopic: Publishing metadata and data
From the Yoda Vault you can submit the dataset forpublication. ADOIwill be generated and registered withDataCitetogether with the metadata. DataCite ensures your dataset becomes findable on the internet and citable. The DOI link will lead to alanding pagein Yoda showing the metadata. The dataset itself can be Open, allowing direct download, Restricted, meaning other researchers need to follow a data request procedure, or Closed, signalling the dataset is properly archived but not available for reuse.

#### Subtopic: Automated workflows
Since Yoda is build on iRODS you could also build (automated) ingest and analysis workflows using iRODS Rules and Policies. Pleasecontact IT for Researchif you need assistance.

#### Subtopic: How to request access
Requesting space is done via a 🔒request form on ServiceNow.Please note that because there can be costs involved (see below) you need to supply a budget code. Once the project space has been created you can start to invite your collaborators yourself. Note that VU students must 🔒connect a token to SURFsecureIDto be able to log in.

#### Subtopic: Intake procedure
When you work with sensitive data we will always schedule a meeting with you to help you to safely work with your data. In the form you can also indicate if you would like some help getting started with Yoda. We can either schedule a short 15 minute meeting to get you started or a longer meeting to have a closer look at your data and help you setting up a workflow.

#### Subtopic: Are there costs involved?
The costs of storing data in Yoda are detailed on the 🔒VU website.

#### Subtopic: Getting Started
The RDM Handbook has practicalmanualsfor users starting with Yoda. More information can be found on theSURF User Knowledge base. TheYoda site of Utrecht Universityalso contains useful information and is being redeveloped so it can also be used by VU Amsterdam and the other Consortium Partners.

#### Subtopic: Contact
Wondering if Yoda fits your research needs? Please contact theRDM support desk.
